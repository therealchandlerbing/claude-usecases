## Overview

This PR delivers two major improvements to the repository:
1. **Comprehensive test coverage improvements** for the 990-ez-preparation orchestrator (51% → 99%)
2. **Repository documentation reorganization** for better maintainability and navigation

---

## 🧪 Test Coverage Improvements

### Achievement
- **Before:** 51% coverage (150/308 statements missed)
- **After:** 99% coverage (1/308 statements missed)
- **Tests:** Expanded from 50 to 73 comprehensive tests
- **Status:** ✅ All tests passing

### New Test Coverage

#### Interactive Methods Testing
Added comprehensive tests for all interactive data collection methods:
- `check_eligibility_interactive()` - 6 scenarios (eligible, ineligible receipts/assets, donor-advised funds, hospitals, invalid input)
- `collect_organization_info()` - Complete data collection workflow
- `collect_financial_data()` - Manual entry, API fallback, low program ratio warnings
- `collect_program_data()` - Multiple programs, single program, no programs
- `collect_governance_data()` - With/without officers, various policy combinations
- `main()` function - Complete workflows, ineligible organizations, validation errors

#### Validation Edge Cases
Enhanced validation testing with error detection scenarios:
- Incorrect revenue sum detection
- Imbalanced balance sheet detection
- Part I/Part II net assets mismatch detection
- Missing policy info messages

### Technical Approach
- Used `unittest.mock.patch` to mock `input()` and `print()` for interactive testing
- Properly sequenced test inputs to match exact flow of main() function
- Created comprehensive test fixtures for all data types
- All tests follow existing structure with appropriate pytest markers

### Files Modified
- `tests/unit/python/test_990_orchestrator.py` - Added 555 lines of comprehensive tests
