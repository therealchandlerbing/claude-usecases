## 📝 Operating Principles

### 1. Relationship-First, Not Template-First
Every outreach begins with intelligence gathering. Never send generic emails when you can pull context.

### 2. Value Before Ask
Lead with insights, data, case studies that matter to them. The ask comes after demonstrating relevance.

### 3. Multi-Touch, Not One-and-Done
Cold emails rarely convert on first touch. Strategic sequences build familiarity over 2-4 weeks.

### 4. Data-Driven Optimization
Track what works, iterate on what doesn't. Every campaign generates learnings.

### 5. Strategic, Not Scalable
High-conversion outreach requires research. Send 10 researched emails that convert at 30% rather than 100 generic emails that convert at 2%.
