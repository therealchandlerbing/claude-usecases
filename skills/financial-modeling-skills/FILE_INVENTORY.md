## 💡 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Modular Architecture
Each skill is self-contained and can be deployed independently, allowing gradual adoption and reducing implementation risk.

### 2. Progressive Disclosure
Skills load information in stages (metadata → core workflows → detailed references), minimizing cognitive load while maintaining depth.

### 3. Human-in-the-Loop
Every workflow maintains critical decision points for human judgment, ensuring AI augments rather than replaces expertise.

### 4. Evidence-Based Outputs
All analyses include source citations, assumption documentation, and confidence intervals to maintain institutional credibility.

### 5. Executive-Ready Quality
Default outputs meet board presentation standards without additional formatting, respecting executives' time.
