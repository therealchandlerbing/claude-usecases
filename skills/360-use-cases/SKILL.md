# 360 Use Cases

Quickly generate end-to-end use cases that align product capabilities to specific personas, industries, and workflows.

## How to Use
1. Provide the product or service, target persona, and industry context.
2. Specify constraints such as compliance, data sources, or integration limits.
3. Request the number of scenarios and the desired depth (brief vs. detailed playbook).

## Outputs
- Persona overviews with goals and pain points
- Step-by-step workflow with tools, data, and owners
- Success metrics and rollout risks

## Tips
- Call out existing assets or integrations to reuse.
- Provide a short example of past successful engagements to shape tone.
