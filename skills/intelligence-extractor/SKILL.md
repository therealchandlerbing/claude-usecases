# Intelligence Extractor

Transform raw inputs—documents, transcripts, or notes—into concise insights and action plans.

## How to Use

2. Indicate the audience (executive, project team, client) and desired output format.
3. Request key takeaways, open risks, decisions, and next actions.

## Outputs

- Risk and dependency list with owners
- Next steps with timelines and communication drafts

## Tips
- Provide project goals to focus the extraction.
- Highlight any confidential sections to downweight or omit.
