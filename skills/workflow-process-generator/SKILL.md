# Workflow & Process Generator

Design clear workflows from a goal statement, including roles, inputs, approvals, and automation opportunities.

## How to Use
1. Provide the business goal, constraints, and systems involved.
2. Share existing playbooks or checkpoints to keep.
3. Request the workflow depth (quick outline vs. detailed SOP) and any outputs (emails, tickets, dashboards).

## Outputs
- End-to-end workflow diagram in text form
- RACI-style role assignments and approvals
- Automation and instrumentation recommendations

## Tips
- Mention compliance or security rules that must be respected.
- Point out known bottlenecks so the plan can address them.
