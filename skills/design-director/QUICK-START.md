# Design Director - Quick Start

**Get professionally designed outputs in 5 minutes**

## One-Line Summary

Transform any visual output (presentations, dashboards, HTML, reports) from functional to professionally polished using systematic design thinking and proven exemplars like Stripe, Linear, and Apple.

## 5 Steps to First Success

### Step 1: Request Your Output (30 seconds)

Just ask naturally:
```
"Create a sales dashboard"
"Make a Q4 strategy presentation"
"Build an HTML landing page"
"Design a financial report"
```

The skill activates automatically for any visual output.

### Step 2: Provide Context (30 seconds)

Include helpful context:
- **Purpose**: What's this for? (persuade, inform, analyze)
- **Audience**: Who sees this? (C-suite, technical team, clients)
- **Exemplar** (optional): "like Stripe" or "Apple-inspired"

### Step 3: Receive Polished Output (Automatic)

You'll get:
- Professional, hand-crafted result
- Consistent typography, color, layout
- Exemplar-aligned quality
- Ready to use immediately

### Step 4: Iterate If Needed (Optional)

Request changes naturally:
```
"Make colors bolder"
"Increase white space"
"Match Linear's style more closely"
"Simplify the design"
```

### Step 5: Understand Choices (Optional)

Want to learn the thinking?
```
"Explain your design choices"
"Why these colors/fonts/layouts?"
```

## Common Invocations

**Basic requests:**
```
"Create a sales dashboard"
"Make a presentation about our Q4 results"
"Build an HTML interface for our tool"
```

**With context:**
```
"Create a sales dashboard for our executive team - make it look like Stripe"
"Make a board presentation - needs to be elegant and professional"
"Build a modern HTML dashboard following Linear's design patterns"
```

**Explicit elevation:**
```
"Elevate this spreadsheet design to professional quality"
"Apply design best practices to this report"
"Make this presentation look hand-crafted, not template-based"
```

## What to Expect

### Time Investment

- **Simple outputs**: 15-20 minutes total processing
- **Complex outputs**: 50-75 minutes for comprehensive elevation
- **You see**: Only the polished result (process is invisible)

### Output Characteristics

Every elevated output will have:
- Deliberate typography hierarchy (not just bigger/bold)
- Intentional color palette from exemplars
- Consistent spacing (8pt or 4pt grid)
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Hand-crafted appearance

### Quality Standards

Your output will:
- Fit in Stripe/Linear/Apple's design system
- Look like a designer made intentional choices
- Be portfolio-worthy quality
- Have no red flags (defaults, poor hierarchy, cramped spacing)

## Built-In Exemplars

The skill automatically selects based on your context:

**Stripe** - Financial dashboards, data-heavy, trust-focused
**Linear** - Product interfaces, modern SaaS, efficient

## Troubleshooting

**Output not elevated enough?**
→ "Apply comprehensive design elevation"

**Too much design?**
→ "Simplify this" or "Apply restraint principles"

**Want specific style?**
→ "Reference [Stripe/Linear/Apple] approach"

**See the thinking?**
→ "Explain your design decisions"

## Quick Commands Reference

| Goal | Command |
|------|---------|
| Maximum elevation | "Apply comprehensive design elevation" |
| Specific style | "Reference [Stripe/Linear/Apple] approach" |
| See rationale | "Show design thinking" |
| Simplify | "Apply restraint principles" |
| Iterate | "Make [change] while maintaining consistency" |

## Core Principles (What Guides the Design)

1. **Professional, not precious** - Design serves content
2. **Confidence through restraint** - 2-3 techniques max
3. **Context-appropriate** - Match intensity to purpose
4. **Specific over generic** - Named colors, not "professional blue"
5. **Borrowed excellence** - Adapt exemplars, don't copy
6. **Hand-crafted appearance** - Intentional, not default

## Next Steps

- **Deep dive**: Read [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) for complete operational details
- **Navigate**: Use [INDEX.md](INDEX.md) to find specific references
- **Examples**: See [examples/](examples/) for transformation cases
- **References**: Explore detailed guides in [references/](references/)
- **Complete guide**: Read [COMPLETE-GUIDE.md](COMPLETE-GUIDE.md) for comprehensive documentation

## Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:
- Colleagues ask "Did you hire a designer?"
- Outputs feel distinctly more professional
- You stop manual formatting tweaks
- Design quality matches content quality
