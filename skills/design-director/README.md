# Design Director

**Category:** Design & Visual Excellence
**Purpose:** Transform functional outputs into professionally polished, design-elevated work
**Framework:** Systematic design elevation following contemporary best practices

## Description

The Design Director skill elevates functional outputs (presentations, spreadsheets, HTML/web interfaces, reports, dashboards) from "works correctly" to "professionally designed" through systematic application of typography, color, layout, hierarchy, and visual refinement techniques.

Unlike generic design advice, this skill enforces a structured 6-phase elevation protocol, references specific exemplars (Stripe, Linear, Apple, Bauhaus, Swiss Design), and provides concrete technique selection guidance to ensure every output looks hand-crafted rather than template-based.

## Use Case

**Primary Use Cases:**
- Elevating functional outputs to professional design quality
- Creating polished dashboards, presentations, and reports
- Building web interfaces that match contemporary design standards
- Ensuring visual consistency across deliverables
- Making data-heavy outputs scannable and beautiful

**When to Use:**
- "Make this dashboard look professional"
- "Elevate this presentation design"
- "Apply design best practices to this spreadsheet"
- "Polish this HTML interface"
- "Make this report look like it came from [Stripe/Linear/Apple]"

**When NOT to Use:**
- For pure functionality questions (use technical skills instead)
- When design quality doesn't matter for the use case
- For quick drafts or internal-only scratch work
- When user explicitly wants minimal/no styling

## Prerequisites

### Required Context
At minimum, provide:
- A functional output (presentation, spreadsheet, HTML, report, dashboard)
- Context about purpose and audience
- Desired design direction or exemplar (optional but helpful)

### Supported Output Types
- **Presentations** (PowerPoint, Google Slides, Keynote)
- **Spreadsheets** (Excel, Google Sheets)
- **HTML/Web Interfaces** (static sites, dashboards, web apps)
- **Reports/Documents** (Word, Google Docs, Markdown)
- **Dashboards** (data visualization, analytics interfaces)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Provide Functional Output

**Share your working output:**
- Attach file or share content directly
- Specify output type if not obvious
- Note any technical constraints (file format, platform, etc.)
- Indicate if certain elements cannot be changed

**Example Invocations:**
```
"Elevate the design of this sales dashboard to match Stripe's quality level."

"Make this presentation look professional - it's for a C-suite audience."

"Apply design best practices to this spreadsheet. The data analysis is done, but it looks generic."

"Polish this HTML interface following Linear's design patterns."
```

### Step 2: Provide Context

**Essential context to share:**
- **Purpose**: What is this for? (persuade, inform, analyze, present)
- **Audience**: Who will see this? (technical, executive, consumer, stakeholders)
- **Constraints**: Any limitations? (brand colors, file format, accessibility requirements)
- **Desired feel**: Professional? Modern? Elegant? Trust-focused?

**Optional enhancements:**
- Target exemplar (Stripe, Linear, Apple, etc.)
- Specific design concerns ("the typography feels weak", "colors are generic")
- Time constraints (quick polish vs. comprehensive elevation)

### Step 3: Design Interrogation (Internal Process)

The skill will internally:
1. Evaluate the functional output against the Design Interrogation Checklist
2. Identify design weaknesses (typography, color, layout, hierarchy, visual elements)
3. Select appropriate exemplar(s) based on context
4. Choose 2-3 high-impact techniques to apply

**You'll receive:**
- Brief summary of what will be elevated (if process visibility needed)
- OR direct polished output (default - no process shown)

### Step 4: Systematic Elevation

The skill applies chosen techniques consistently:
- Typography scale and hierarchy
- Color palette from exemplars
- Spacing and layout refinement
- Visual element polish
- Context-specific optimizations

**Quality standards:**
- Hand-crafted appearance (not template-based)
- Consistent application throughout
- Exemplar-aligned quality
- Professional portfolio-ready result

### Step 5: Receive Polished Output

**Default delivery (no process shown):**
- Polished file/code directly
- Brief description of key improvements
- Highlight of signature design choices
- Ready to use immediately

**Extended delivery (if requested):**
- Polished file/code
- Design rationale for 2-3 key decisions
- Exemplar references used
- Techniques applied
- Suggestions for future consistency

### Step 6: Iterate if Needed

**Request refinements:**
- "Make the typography more dramatic"
- "Use more restrained colors"
- "Increase white space"
- "Match [exemplar] more closely"
- "Make it more [professional/modern/elegant]"

**Add constraints:**
- "Keep these brand colors but make it work better"
- "Stay in PowerPoint's limitations"
- "This needs to be accessible (WCAG AA)"

## The 6-Phase Elevation Protocol

The skill follows this systematic process internally:

### Phase 1: Functional Foundation
Verify content accuracy and core functionality before aesthetic work.

### Phase 2: Design Interrogation
Evaluate against comprehensive checklist:
- Typography (scale, hierarchy, readability)
- Color (palette, application, accessibility)
- Layout & Spacing (grid, white space, alignment)
- Hierarchy & Structure (visual levels, scannability)
- Visual Elements (shadows, borders, depth)
- Context-Specific (output type requirements)

### Phase 3: Technique Selection
Choose 2-3 high-impact techniques from catalog:
- Typography techniques (scale, weight, spacing)
- Color techniques (palettes, application patterns)
- Layout techniques (grids, spacing systems)
- Visual elements (shadows, borders, rounding)
- Data visualization (chart styling, table enhancement)
- Interaction design (button hierarchy, states)

### Phase 4: Systematic Application
Apply chosen techniques consistently throughout entire output.

### Phase 5: Quality Validation
Verify against:
- Interrogation checklist (all criteria met)
- Exemplar comparison (similar quality level)
- Hand-crafted verification (not template-based)
- Red flags check (no generic defaults)

### Phase 6: Delivery Preparation
Present polished result with appropriate context.

## Notes

### Design Philosophy Core

**Professional, Not Precious:**
Every visual choice serves the content. Design elevates function without overwhelming it.

**Confidence Through Restraint:**
True excellence shows in what you leave out. 2-3 deliberate techniques create more impact than 10 mediocre ones.

**Context-Appropriate Excellence:**
Match design intensity to audience, purpose, medium, and information density. A sales dashboard needs different treatment than a strategic memo.

**Specific Over Generic:**
Never use "professional blue" when you could use "Stripe's #0A2540". Precision creates consistency.

### Common Pitfalls Avoided

**Generic defaults:**
- Skill replaces default blues/grays/greens with exemplar-specific palettes
- Avoids Arial/Times New Roman without consideration
- Eliminates default padding/spacing

**Poor hierarchy:**
- Skill creates meaningful size relationships (2.5-3x, not 1.5x)
- Uses weight, spacing, and color for hierarchy
- Ensures scannability and clear visual levels

**Template appearance:**
- Deliberate choices throughout (not defaults)
- Hand-crafted white space
- Exemplar-aligned quality
- No "could swap with template" feel

**Over-designing:**
- Limited to 2-3 techniques maximum
- Function never sacrificed for form
- Restraint in decorative elements
- Clear serves content principle

### Accessibility Considerations

**Color contrast:**
- Minimum 4.5:1 for text
- WCAG AA compliance by default
- WCAG AAA when requested

**Typography:**
- Readable sizes (14-16px minimum for body)
- Clear hierarchy helps all users
- Generous line height for reading comfort

**Interaction design:**
- Focus states always included (never removed)
- Touch targets 44x44px minimum for web
- Keyboard navigation considered

### Performance Considerations

**Web/HTML outputs:**
- System fonts preferred when possible
- Limited custom font variants
- Optimized images recommended
- Performance affects design choices

### Multi-Output Consistency

**When elevating multiple related outputs:**
- Skill maintains consistent design language across all
- Reuses palette, typography, spacing systems
- Adapts techniques appropriately per output type
- Ensures cohesive design system
