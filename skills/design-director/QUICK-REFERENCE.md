# Design Director Skill - Quick Reference

## One-Line Summary
Automatically elevates any visual output (presentations, dashboards, HTML, reports) from functional to professionally polished using systematic design thinking and proven exemplars.

## Activation
**Automatic**: Triggers when you request any visual output
**Manual**: Say "apply design-director skill" if needed

## Core Process (Invisible to You)
1. Build functional version
2. Interrogate every design choice
3. Select 2-3 specific techniques
4. Apply consistently
5. Validate against professional standards
6. Deliver polished result

## Key Features
- **Systematic interrogation**: No default choices accepted
- **Reference proven exemplars**: Stripe, Linear, Apple, Bauhaus, Swiss design
- **Specific techniques**: "Headlines 2.5x body, not 1.5x" (not generic advice)
- **Output-appropriate**: Matches design intensity to purpose
- **Hand-crafted appearance**: Looks like a designer made intentional choices

## What You Get

### Before Skill
- Generic templates
- Default colors/fonts
- Obvious AI origin
- Functional but mediocre

### After Skill
- Specific design references
- Deliberate palettes
- Hand-crafted appearance
- Professional quality

## Usage Patterns

### Basic (Default)
Just ask naturally:
- "Create a sales dashboard"
- "Make a Q4 strategy presentation"
- "Build an HTML landing page"

Result: Polished output, no process shown

### See Design Thinking
Ask explicitly:
- "Show me the design thinking"
- "Explain your design choices"
- "Why these colors/fonts/layouts?"

Result: Polished output + rationale

### Iteration
Request changes:
- "Make colors bolder"
- "Increase white space"
- "Style like Stripe/Linear/Apple"

Result: Maintains consistency while incorporating changes

## Built-In Exemplars

**Stripe** → Financial interfaces, dashboards, trust
**Linear** → Product tools, modern, efficient
**Apple** → Consumer-facing, elegant, minimal
**Notion** → Content-first, collaborative
**Bauhaus** → Geometric, bold, systematic
**Swiss Design** → Grid-based, typography-focused

Claude picks the right reference automatically based on purpose, audience, and medium.

## Output-Specific Quick Tips

### Presentations
Focus: Visual hierarchy, storytelling
Reference: Apple, Linear
Watch: Too much text, poor contrast

### Spreadsheets
Focus: Scannability, data clarity
Reference: Stripe, Linear
Watch: No hierarchy, default formatting

### HTML/Web
Focus: Interaction, responsive layout
Reference: Stripe, Linear
Watch: No hover states, inconsistent spacing

### Reports
Focus: Reading comfort, credibility
Reference: Swiss design, Apple
Watch: Dense text, no white space

### Dashboards
Focus: Information clarity at density
Reference: Stripe (definitive)
Watch: Default colors, visual clutter

## Design Principles (Built In)

**Professional, not precious** - Design serves content
**Confidence through restraint** - 2-3 techniques maximum
**Context-appropriate** - Match intensity to audience
**Specific over generic** - Named colors, not "professional blue"
**Borrowed excellence** - Adapt exemplars, don't copy
**Hand-crafted appearance** - Intentional, not default

## Quality Validation (Automatic)

Every output checked:
- Would this fit in Stripe/Linear/Apple?
- Does it look hand-crafted?
- Are 2-3 signature choices evident?
- Is every choice defensible?
- Portfolio-worthy?

If "no" to any, design is refined.

## Troubleshooting

**Output not elevated enough?**
→ Ask: "Apply comprehensive design elevation"

**Output too fancy?**
→ Say: "Simplify this design" or "Apply restraint principles"

**Want specific style?**
→ Mention: "Reference Stripe/Linear/Apple approach"

**Need to understand choices?**
→ Ask: "Explain your design decisions"

## Time Investment (Invisible)

**Simple outputs**: ~15-20 minutes elevation
**Complex outputs**: ~50-75 minutes elevation
**You see**: Only the polished result

## Success Indicators

- Colleagues ask: "Did you hire a designer?"
- Visual outputs feel professional
- Design quality matches content quality
- You stop manual formatting tweaks
- Presentations command more attention

## When to Use

**Use for:**
- Presentations, dashboards, reports
- HTML pages, interfaces, web apps
- PDFs, documents, proposals
- Data visualizations, charts
- Any visual output

**Don't expect help with:**
- Content strategy (what to say)
- Data analysis (insights)
- Code functionality
- Writing quality

Skill elevates visual design, not content creation.

## Integration with Your Work

**360 Social Impact Studios contexts:**
- Investor pitch decks (Apple-inspired elegance)
- Partner dashboards (Stripe-inspired clarity)
- Strategy reports (Swiss design systematic approach)
- Project proposals (Linear-inspired modern)
- Board presentations (High-stakes comprehensive elevation)

**Cross-cultural considerations:**
The skill adapts to any context. Design principles (hierarchy, color, spacing) are universal, but you can request culture-specific adaptations.

## Quick Commands

**Maximum elevation**: "Apply comprehensive design elevation"
**Specific style**: "Reference [Stripe/Linear/Apple] approach"
**See thinking**: "Show design rationale"
**Simplify**: "Apply restraint principles"
**Iterate**: "Make [specific change] while maintaining consistency"

## What Makes This Special

Not templates. Not generic advice. Systematic design thinking:
- Interrogates every choice
- References proven exemplars
- Applies specific techniques
- Ensures consistency
- Validates quality

Result: Hand-crafted professional quality, every time.

3. **Iterate**: Request changes as needed
4. **Learn**: Ask "explain design choices" to understand

That's it. The skill handles everything else.
