4. **Complete first assessment** (2-4 hours)
5. **Identify gaps and priorities** (30 minutes)

**Time Investment:** ~4-6 hours for initial orientation and baseline assessment

---

### Workflow 2: Preparing Vianeo Submission

**Goal:** Create evidence-based submission with all dimensions ≥ 3.5

**Steps:**
1. **Baseline:** Complete 29-question-market-maturity-assessment.md
2. **Plan:** Identify dimensions < 3.0, read sprint-execution-guide.md
3. **Execute:** Conduct validation research, use needs-qualification-matrix.md

### Workflow 3: Improving Dimension Scores

**Goal:** Raise specific dimension from 2.5 to 4.0

**Steps:**
1. **Identify:** Which dimension needs improvement? (from 29-question assessment)
2. **Understand:** Read relevant section in sprint-execution-guide.md "Troubleshooting by Vianeo Dimension"
3. **Plan:** What evidence is missing? (see 29-question scoring criteria)
4. **Execute:** Conduct targeted research
5. **Re-assess:** Re-score that dimension

**Example for Desirability:**
- **Current Score:** 2.5 (weak validation)
- **Gap:** Need customer interviews (currently 0-2)
- **Plan:** Conduct 7-10 customer interviews
- **Tools:** Use needs-qualification-matrix.md, sprint-execution-guide.md (persona pitfalls)
- **Re-assess:** Target score 4.0 (strong validation)

---

### Workflow 4: Team Training on Validation Standards

## Component Integration

### How Assessment Instruments Work Together

**40-Question Diagnostic + 29-Question Market Maturity:**
- **40-Question:** Internal readiness (team, technology, operations)
- **29-Question:** External validation (market, customers, ecosystem)
- **Together:** Comprehensive view of project readiness

**Use Both When:**
- Need complete assessment (internal + external)
- Identifying whether gaps are internal capability or external validation
- Tracking holistic project maturity

**Scoring Comparison:**
- Strong internal (40-Q ≥ 4.0), weak external (29-Q < 3.0) = "Solution looking for a problem"
- Weak internal (40-Q < 3.0), strong external (29-Q ≥ 4.0) = "Market opportunity, execution risk"
- Both strong = Ready for scale
- Both weak = Foundational work needed

---

### How Tools Support Assessments

**Needs Qualification Matrix → 29-Question Assessment:**
- Matrix provides evidence for Desirability dimension questions
- Q2: Identifies people with strong needs
- Q7: Documents validated needs from interviews
- Q28: Enables prioritization of needs

**Sprint Execution Guide → All Assessments:**
- Provides quality standards for scoring
- Helps avoid optimistic bias
- Ensures evidence-based assessment
- Troubleshoots common issues

**Platform Character Limits → Submission Prep:**
- After completing assessments, use to format content
- Ensures submission compatibility
- Preserves critical context within constraints

## Common Questions

### Q: Where do I start?
**A:** Read README.md first for framework overview. Then complete 29-question-market-maturity-assessment.md if focused on Vianeo submission, or 40-question-diagnostic-scan.md if focused on internal readiness.

---

### Q: I've completed the 29-Question Assessment and have low scores. What next?
**A:**
1. Identify which dimensions scored < 3.0 (critical gaps)
2. Read sprint-execution-guide.md section "Troubleshooting by Vianeo Dimension"
3. Review 29-question-market-maturity-assessment.md scoring criteria for those questions to understand what evidence is needed
4. Plan validation research to gather missing evidence
5. Re-assess after validation work

---

### Q: How do I know if my content fits Vianeo platform requirements?
**A:** Use platform-character-limits.md. Review field-by-field limits, use writing techniques to edit, validate with Quick Validation Checklist before submission.

---

### Q: How do I prioritize which customer needs to address first?
**A:** Complete the needs-qualification-matrix.md. Identify CRITICAL priority needs (high importance, low satisfaction) and prioritize those for MVP development.

---

### Q: Our team scores the same questions differently. How do we calibrate?
**A:**
1. Review sprint-execution-guide.md scoring criteria together
2. Discuss what evidence counts as "score 4" vs. "score 3"
3. Complete practice assessment individually, then compare as group
4. Agree on evidence standards and document them
5. Use second reviewer to validate scores going forward

---

### Q: What score do I need for a competitive Vianeo submission?
**A:**
- **Competitive:** All dimensions ≥ 3.0, overall ≥ 3.5
- **Strong:** All dimensions ≥ 3.5, overall ≥ 4.0
- **Exceptional:** All dimensions ≥ 4.0, overall ≥ 4.5

See 29-question-market-maturity-assessment.md "Vianeo Framework Targets" section.

---

### Q: How often should I re-assess?
**A:**
- **Quarterly:** If in active validation/development
- **After major milestones:** Customer interviews, prototype testing, pilot launch, etc.
- **Before submission:** Always re-assess before Vianeo platform submission
- **After feedback:** If Vianeo provides feedback, re-assess to measure improvement

---

### Q: Can I use parts of this framework without doing the full assessment?
**A:** Yes. Each component is modular:
- Use platform-character-limits.md standalone for formatting
- Use sprint-execution-guide.md for training without full assessment
- Use needs-qualification-matrix.md for prioritization anytime
- Complete only relevant sections of assessment instruments
