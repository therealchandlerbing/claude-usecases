## Problem Statements

### Pitfall: Embedding the solution in the problem description

**What It Is:**
The problem statement should describe the challenge, not prescribe a specific solution. When you embed your product/service in the problem description, you constrain thinking and waste precious characters.

**Why It's a Problem:**
- Limits exploration of alternative solutions
- Makes the problem appear narrower than it is
- Reduces credibility with evaluators who see through the framing
- Wastes character count in constrained fields (250 char limit)

**How to Avoid:**
1. **Use the "How might we..." format** to frame the problem
2. **Focus on the user need or pain point**, not your product
3. **Test it:** Can someone read your problem statement and imagine multiple different solutions?

**Examples:**

❌ **Poor: Solution embedded**
> "How might we create a mobile app to help seniors maintain cognitive sharpness?"

**Issues:**
- Embeds "mobile app" as the only solution
- Constrains thinking to mobile-first approach
- Could be web-based, device-based, service-based, etc.

✅ **Better: Solution-neutral**
> "How might we help seniors maintain cognitive sharpness during aging?"

**Why It's Better:**
- Opens space for multiple solution approaches (app, device, service, program)
- Focuses on the core need (maintain cognitive sharpness)
- Allows for innovation in solution approach

---

**More Examples:**

| Poor (Solution Embedded) | Better (Solution-Neutral) |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| "How might we build a dashboard to track project metrics?" | "How might we help teams understand project health in real-time?" |
| "How might we create an online course to teach coding?" | "How might we help beginners learn coding effectively?" |
| "How might we develop a sensor to monitor soil moisture?" | "How might we help farmers optimize irrigation decisions?" |

---

**Quick Test:**
Ask yourself: "If I remove the solution words (app, dashboard, sensor, course), does the problem still make sense?"

If yes → solution-neutral ✅
If no → solution embedded ❌

---

**Character Limit Note:**
Problem statements have a 250-character limit on the Vianeo platform. Every character counts. Don't waste characters describing your solution—describe the problem clearly and concisely.

See [Platform Character Limits](platform-character-limits.md) for detailed guidance.

## Scoring and Evidence

### Pitfall 1: Scoring without sufficient evidence

**What It Is:**
Assigning scores based on assumptions, aspirations, or optimism rather than validated data.

**Why It's a Problem:**
- Leads to overconfidence in weak areas
- Hides critical gaps that need attention
- Reduces credibility with evaluators
- Results in poor strategic decisions

**How to Avoid:**
1. **Default to a score of 1 with notation "Insufficient data"** when evidence is lacking
2. **Require specific evidence citations** for any score of 4 or 5
3. **Use the reliability ratings system** for transparency

---

**Scoring Scale (1-5):**

**5 = Exceptional**
- Best-in-class evidence
- Multiple validated sources
- External validation (not just internal belief)
- Quantitative data with statistical significance
- Example: 10+ customer interviews with consistent findings

**4 = Strong**
- Above-average validation with minor gaps
- Good evidence from multiple sources
- Some external validation
- Mix of quantitative and qualitative data
- Example: 5-9 customer interviews with clear patterns

**3 = Adequate**
- Basic requirements met
- Some validation evidence
- Primarily internal or limited external validation
- Mostly qualitative data
- Example: 3-4 customer conversations

**2 = Weak**
- Significant gaps requiring attention
- Minimal validation
- Primarily assumptions or hypotheses
- Anecdotal evidence only
- Example: 1-2 casual conversations

**1 = Critical gap**
- Major deficiency
- No evidence available
- Completely hypothetical
- Area not yet explored
- Example: No customer contact on this topic

---

**Evidence Reliability Ratings:**

When documenting evidence, use these reliability ratings:

- **More than 5 interviewed:** Strong evidence base
- **Less than 5 interviewed:** Preliminary validation
- **Not yet interviewed:** Hypothesis only
- **Unspecified:** No data available

---

**Example Evidence Documentation:**

**Question:** "You have identified people with strong needs AND who are looking for solutions to better meet their needs."

❌ **Poor Scoring:**
- **Score:** 5
- **Justification:** "We believe our target users really need this solution."
- **Issue:** No evidence, just belief

✅ **Good Scoring:**
- **Score:** 4
- **Evidence:** "Interviewed 7 senior living facility directors. 6 of 7 reported active budget allocation for cognitive health tools. 5 of 7 currently piloting competing solutions, expressing dissatisfaction with cost ($12K annually) and complexity (requires trained staff)."
- **Reliability:** More than 5 interviewed
- **Why Score 4:** Strong evidence from validated sources, minor gap (only 7 interviews, could use more)

✅ **Good Scoring (Low Score):**
- **Score:** 2
- **Evidence:** "Spoke with 1 facility director who expressed interest. Have not validated with additional stakeholders. Assumed need based on industry trends."
- **Reliability:** Less than 5 interviewed
- **Why Score 2:** Minimal validation, primarily assumption
- **Next Steps:** Conduct 5-10 additional interviews to validate need

---

### Pitfall 2: Optimistic scoring bias

**What It Is:**
Tendency to score aspirations rather than current reality. Teams rate where they want to be or think they should be, not where they actually are.

**Why It's a Problem:**
- Masks critical gaps that need attention
- Leads to under-investment in important areas
- Reduces trust with evaluators
- Results in poor planning and resource allocation

**How to Avoid:**
1. **Ask:** "What evidence supports this score?"
2. **Distinguish** between what exists today vs. what could exist
3. **Have a second evaluator** review scores independently
4. **Remember:** Lower scores identify where work is needed, which is valuable

---

**Self-Assessment Questions:**

Before finalizing a score, ask:

1. **Evidence:** "Can I point to specific documents, data, or conversations that support this score?"
2. **External Validation:** "Has someone outside our team confirmed this, or is it just our belief?"
3. **Quantification:** "Do I have numbers (counts, percentages, amounts) or just qualitative impressions?"
4. **Recency:** "Is this evidence current (within 6 months) or outdated?"
5. **Consistency:** "Have multiple sources confirmed this, or is it based on a single data point?"

If you answer "no" or "uncertain" to multiple questions → **lower the score**.

---

**Example Correction:**

**Initial Self-Assessment:**
- **Q7:** "You have checked through direct interviews, with at least 5 people with the same profile, that they express needs."
- **Score:** 4
- **Justification:** "We talked to several people and they liked the idea."

**After Self-Assessment Questions:**
1. Evidence? "We have notes from 3 conversations"
2. External validation? "Yes, 3 people"
3. Quantification? "Not really, just general interest"
4. Recency? "2 months ago"
5. Consistency? "Yes, all 3 expressed interest"

**Corrected Score:** 3 (not 4)
- **Rationale:** Only 3 people (not 5+), limited quantification, interest expressed but needs not deeply validated

---

**Bias Check:**

Common optimistic scoring patterns:

| Area | Optimistic Bias | Reality Check |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| **Customer Interviews** | "We talked to many customers" | Count: How many exactly? 3 is not "many" |
| **Market Size** | "Huge market opportunity" | Numbers: TAM/SAM/SOM calculated and sourced? |
| **Competitive Advantage** | "We're the only ones doing this" | Research: Comprehensive competitor analysis done? |
| **Technical Feasibility** | "We can definitely build this" | Evidence: Prototype tested? Proof of concept validated? |
| **Revenue Model** | "Customers will definitely pay" | Validation: Tested pricing with real customers? |

---

## User and Client Personas

### Pitfall: Generic or vague personas

**What It Is:**
Creating personas that could describe almost anyone ("busy professionals aged 25-45") or that lack behavioral specificity.

**Why It's a Problem:**
- Generic personas don't guide design or strategy decisions
- Can't validate vague personas with research
- Doesn't help prioritize features or positioning
- Reduces credibility of validation work

**How to Avoid:**
1. **Include specific behaviors**, not just demographics
2. **Use actual quotes** from interviews
3. **Describe their current workarounds** or solutions
4. **Name their specific pain points** with real examples

---

**Good Persona Structure:**

**1. Who they are:**
- Specific role and context
- Not just demographics, but situational characteristics
- Example: "Senior Living Facility Activities Director managing 120 residents across 3 buildings"

**2. What they do:**
- Actual behaviors and patterns
- Frequency, tools, processes
- Example: "Conducts group cognitive activities 5x weekly, tracks attendance in Excel, reports quarterly to medical director"

**3. What they need:**
- Specific unmet needs
- Quantified when possible
- Example: "Needs objective cognitive baseline for each resident to detect 10%+ decline before family notices"

**4. How they currently solve it:**
- Existing solutions and workarounds
- Costs, limitations, pain points
- Example: "Uses paper-based cognitive games, manually scores, no longitudinal tracking. Takes 30 min per resident monthly."

**5. Direct quote:**
- Something they actually said in research
- Validates the persona is grounded in real data
- Example: "I can tell when someone is slipping, but I can't prove it. By the time we document it formally, they've already declined significantly."

---

**Examples:**

❌ **Poor Persona (Generic):**

**Name:** Busy Professional
**Age:** 25-45
**Location:** Urban areas
**Needs:** Better work-life balance, productivity tools
**Goal:** Be more efficient

**Issues:**
- Could describe millions of people
- No specific behaviors
- Vague needs
- No validation evidence
- Doesn't guide decisions

---

✅ **Good Persona (Specific):**

**Name:** Sarah Chen, Senior Living Activities Director
**Context:** Manages cognitive wellness programming for 120 residents across 3 memory care buildings at a 300-unit senior living community
**Age:** 42, 8 years in role

**Behaviors:**
- Conducts 5 group cognitive activities weekly (puzzles, memory games, trivia)
- Tracks attendance in Excel, notes "seemed off today" observations
- Reports quarterly to Medical Director and families
- Coordinates with 4 caregivers per building
- Budgets $15K annually for activities and materials

**Pain Points:**
- Cannot objectively quantify resident cognitive baselines or track decline
- Families ask "how is mom doing cognitively?" – relies on anecdotal observations
- Medical director requests data before moving residents to higher care levels, but has no quantitative system
- Spends 30 minutes per resident monthly on manual paper-based assessments with no longitudinal tracking
- Missed early decline in 3 residents last year, resulting in family complaints and medical director scrutiny

**Current Solutions:**
- Paper-based cognitive games (word searches, puzzles) - $800/year
- Manual scoring and observation notes - 10 hours/week
- Quarterly written reports to medical director - 4 hours per report
- No technology solutions (tried one iPad app, too complex for residents and staff)

**Unmet Needs:**
- Objective cognitive baseline for each resident
- Automated tracking to detect 10%+ decline
- Simple interface for residents (large buttons, clear instructions)
- Dashboard for medical director and families
- Minimal staff training required (<1 hour)

**Direct Quote:**
> "I can tell when someone is slipping, but I can't prove it. By the time we document it formally and get family and medical director aligned, they've already declined significantly. I need data, not just my gut feeling."

**Validation:**
- Based on 8 interviews with activities directors at senior living communities (80-200 residents)
- Consistent patterns across 7 of 8 interviewees
- Pain points quantified through follow-up questions
- Current solution costs confirmed via budget documents

**Desirability Score:** 4 (Strong validation, 8 interviews, quantified pain points)

---

### Pitfall: Confusing users with buyers/clients

**What It Is:**
Treating the person who uses the solution and the person who pays for it as the same entity.

**Why It's a Problem:**
- User needs and buyer needs often differ significantly
- Pricing, positioning, and features must address both
- Sales strategy must target the decision-maker, not just the user
- Can lead to product-market fit for users but no business model

**How to Avoid:**
1. **Create separate personas** for users and clients if they differ
2. **Map the decision-making process:** Who influences? Who approves? Who pays?
3. **Clarify in the Business Model Canvas:** "Your users" vs. "Your clients"
4. **Consider that needs may differ** between these groups

---

**Example Multi-Stakeholder Mapping:**

**Scenario:** Senior cognitive monitoring solution

**User (End User):**
- **Who:** Senior living resident
- **Needs:** Easy to use, not intimidating, feels like a game
- **Decision Power:** Low (influences through satisfaction)
- **Pays:** No

**Client (Buyer/Decision-Maker):**
- **Who:** Senior living facility administrator / Medical director
- **Needs:** Objective data, regulatory compliance, liability reduction, family satisfaction
- **Decision Power:** High (budget authority)
- **Pays:** Yes ($X per resident per month)

**Influencer:**
- **Who:** Family members of residents
- **Needs:** Peace of mind, transparency, early warning of decline
- **Decision Power:** Medium (influences facility, not direct buyer)
- **Pays:** No (but may influence facility choice)

**End Beneficiary:**
- **Who:** Resident's long-term health outcomes
- **Needs:** Early intervention, maintained quality of life
- **Decision Power:** None directly
- **Pays:** No

---

**Value Proposition Must Address Multiple Stakeholders:**

| Stakeholder | Their Question | Your Answer |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Resident (User)** | "Is this easy and enjoyable?" | "Feels like fun brain games, 10 min daily, large buttons" |
| **Administrator (Client)** | "Does this reduce liability and satisfy families?" | "Objective decline tracking, automated family reports, meets care standards" |
| **Medical Director (Approver)** | "Is this clinically valid?" | "Validated against clinical standards, 85% correlation with formal assessments" |
| **Family (Influencer)** | "Will I know if mom is declining?" | "Monthly email updates with trend charts, alerts for significant changes" |

---

**Business Model Implications:**

**If User ≠ Client:**
- **Pricing:** Based on client's budget and ROI, not user's willingness to pay
- **Features:** Must satisfy both user experience and client needs (reporting, compliance, etc.)
- **Sales Strategy:** Target the client/decision-maker, but demonstrate user satisfaction
- **Marketing:** Different messages for users vs. clients

**Example:**
- **User Message (Resident):** "Fun brain games that keep you sharp"
- **Client Message (Administrator):** "Reduce liability with objective cognitive tracking and automated family reporting"

---

## Needs Statements

### Pitfall: Overlapping or redundant needs

**What It Is:**
Writing multiple needs statements that essentially say the same thing, just phrased differently.

**Why It's a Problem:**
- Wastes limited needs statement slots (character limits apply)
- Makes prioritization difficult (which need is more important if they're the same?)
- Reduces clarity for evaluators
- Suggests lack of research depth

**How to Avoid:**
1. **Ensure each need is distinct and measurable**
2. **Test:** Could you satisfy one need without satisfying the other?
3. **Avoid breaking down a single need into false subcategories**
4. **Prioritize:** Which needs are most critical?

**Character Limit:** Each need statement is limited to 60 characters on the Vianeo platform.

See [Platform Character Limits](platform-character-limits.md) for detailed guidance.

---

**Examples:**

❌ **Poor (Overlapping):**

1. "Maintain brain health"
2. "Keep mind sharp"
3. "Prevent cognitive decline"

**Issues:**
- All three essentially describe the same need
- No meaningful distinction between them
- Wastes 3 needs statement slots
- Suggests shallow research

**Reality:** These are all the same core need phrased differently. Pick the most specific and measurable one.

---

✅ **Better (Distinct):**

1. "Track cognitive performance objectively over time"
2. "Practice evidence-based brain training exercises daily"
3. "Identify early decline signs before clinical diagnosis"

**Why It's Better:**
- Each need is distinct and addresses a different aspect
- Need 1: Measurement/tracking
- Need 2: Intervention/training
- Need 3: Early detection
- You could satisfy one without satisfying the others
- Each need could inform a different feature or solution component

---

**Distinctiveness Test:**

Ask: "Could I satisfy Need A without satisfying Need B?"

**Example:**
- Need A: "Track cognitive performance objectively"
- Need B: "Practice evidence-based brain training"

**Test:** Could I provide a tracking solution (dashboards, reports, metrics) without providing training exercises?
- **Answer:** Yes, they're distinct needs.

**Counterexample:**
- Need A: "Track cognitive health"
- Need B: "Monitor brain function over time"

**Test:** Could I provide tracking without monitoring over time?
- **Answer:** No, tracking inherently implies monitoring over time. These are redundant.

---

**Good Practice: Needs Hierarchy**

Organize needs from general to specific to ensure distinctiveness:

**Level 1: High-Level Need (General)**
- "Understand cognitive health status"

**Level 2: Specific Needs (Distinct)**
- "Track cognitive performance objectively over time"
- "Compare performance to age-matched baselines"
- "Identify early warning signs of decline"
- "Access interventions when decline is detected"
- "Share data with healthcare providers easily"

Each Level 2 need is a specific aspect of the Level 1 need, and they're all distinct from each other.

## When You're Stuck

Use these decision trees when you encounter common blockers:

### If you're not sure about a score:

**Decision Tree:**
1. **Do you have evidence?**
   - Yes → Proceed to step 2
   - No → **Score = 1**, note "Insufficient data", identify what evidence you need

2. **Is the evidence from external sources (customers, partners, market research)?**
   - Yes → Proceed to step 3
   - No (internal only) → **Max score = 3**

3. **How many validation sources?**
   - 10+ → Consider score 5
   - 5-9 → Consider score 4
   - 3-4 → Consider score 3
   - 1-2 → Score 2
   - 0 → Score 1

4. **Is the evidence quantified and recent (<6 months)?**
   - Yes → Use score from step 3
   - No → Reduce score by 1

---

### If personas feel generic:

**Action Steps:**
1. **Go back to your interviews:** What specific thing did someone say or do that surprised you?
2. **Add behavioral details:** What do they do daily/weekly? What tools do they use?
3. **Quantify pain points:** How much time/money does the problem cost them?
4. **Name current solutions:** What specific products/services do they use now?
5. **Include a direct quote:** What exact words did they use to describe their pain?

**If you don't have interviews yet:**
- **Acknowledge it:** Mark persona as "Inferred" or "Hypothesis"
- **Lower the score:** Inferred personas max out at score 2
- **Plan validation:** Identify 5-10 people to interview
- **Use interview question templates:** See [Vianeo Persona Builder](../../vianeo-persona-builder/references/interview-question-templates.md) for question guides

---

### If needs overlap:

**Test:** Could I satisfy Need A without satisfying Need B?
- **Yes** → Needs are distinct, keep both
- **No** → Needs overlap, combine them or pick the most specific

**If you're not sure, ask:**
- "What feature or solution component would address Need A?"
- "What feature or solution component would address Need B?"
- "Are these the same feature or different?"
  - Same feature → Needs overlap, combine
  - Different features → Needs are distinct, keep both

---

### If you're over character limit:

**Emergency Editing Steps:**
1. **Remove adjectives first** ("comprehensive analysis" → "analysis")
2. **Convert phrases to single words** ("make a decision" → "decide")
3. **Use active voice** ("was identified by team" → "team identified")
4. **Cut redundant information** ("track and monitor" → "track")
5. **Combine related ideas** into compound sentences

See [Platform Character Limits - Emergency Editing Tips](platform-character-limits.md#emergency-editing-tips) for detailed guidance.

---

### If you're not getting traction with interviews:

**Problem Diagnosis:**

**Issue 1:** "People won't agree to interviews"
- **Solution:** Change your ask. Instead of "Can I interview you about [product]?" try "Can I get your advice on a problem we're exploring?"
- **Better Framing:** Position yourself as a learner, not a seller

**Issue 2:** "Interviews are too superficial, not getting depth"
- **Solution:** Ask "why" 3-5 times. When someone says "I need better tools," ask "Why is that important?" Then ask why again about their answer.
- **Better Questions:** Use open-ended questions: "Tell me about the last time you..." or "Walk me through your process for..."

**Issue 3:** "Interview answers are biased toward being positive"
- **Solution:** Ask about their current solution and pain points, not about your idea. "What do you use today and what frustrates you about it?"
- **Better Approach:** Observe their current behavior if possible, don't just rely on what they say they'd do

See [Vianeo Persona Builder - Interview Question Templates](../../vianeo-persona-builder/references/interview-question-templates.md) for detailed interview guidance.

## Troubleshooting by Vianeo Dimension

Use this reference to identify which dimension needs work based on common gaps:

### LEGITIMACY (Foundation & Problem Validation)
**Common Gaps:**
- Problem not clearly defined
- No evidence problem is widespread or significant
- Market/application field too broad or unclear

**Solutions:**
- Conduct problem validation interviews (5-10)
- Quantify problem impact (time, cost, frequency)
- Narrow market definition to specific segment
- Use solution-neutral problem framing

---

### DESIRABILITY (Customer Needs & Market Fit)
**Common Gaps:**
- Generic personas without behavioral specificity
- Needs not validated through customer research
- No evidence of customer interest or willingness to pay
- Product/market fit assumed, not tested

**Solutions:**
- Conduct customer interviews (5-10 per persona)
- Create specific behavioral personas with quotes
- Develop distinct needs statements (not overlapping)
- Test value proposition and pricing with customers
- Use Needs Qualification Matrix to prioritize

---

### ACCEPTABILITY (Ecosystem & Stakeholder Support)
**Common Gaps:**
- Ecosystem not mapped beyond customers and competitors
- Supporters and opponents not identified
- Regulatory landscape unclear
- Market structure not understood

**Solutions:**
- Map ecosystem (20+ players including influencers, partners, regulators)
- Identify supporters with commitments
- Analyze regulatory requirements and trends
- Create market organization diagram with relationships

---

### FEASIBILITY (Technical & Operational Viability)
**Common Gaps:**
- Team incomplete or not fully committed
- Resources (funding, equipment, skills) insufficient
- No differentiating assets or competitive moat
- Make vs. buy decisions not thought through

**Solutions:**
- Complete resource inventory (team, funding, IP, equipment)
- Secure team commitments (equity, contracts)
- Identify and protect differentiating assets (patents, data, partnerships)
- Conduct make vs. buy analysis
- Develop partnerships for non-core capabilities

---

### VIABILITY (Business Model & Financial Health)
**Common Gaps:**
- Revenue model not defined or tested
- Value proposition not clear or validated
- No go-to-market strategy or resources
- Unit economics unknown or unprofitable

**Solutions:**
- Define revenue streams and test pricing with customers (3+ per segment)
- Develop clear one-sentence value propositions per segment
- Create go-to-market plan with budget and channels
- Calculate unit economics (CAC, LTV, margins)
- Validate willingness-to-pay

## Summary: Quick Reference

### Top 5 Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Embedding solutions in problem statements**
   - Fix: Use "How might we..." format, focus on the problem, not your product

2. **Scoring without evidence**
   - Fix: Default to score 1 when evidence is missing, require citations for scores 4-5

3. **Generic personas**
   - Fix: Include specific behaviors, quotes, quantified pain points, current solutions

4. **Overlapping needs**
   - Fix: Test distinctiveness—could you satisfy one need without the other?

5. **Confusing users with buyers**
   - Fix: Create separate personas, map decision-making process, address both stakeholders

### When You're Stuck

- **Uncertain score?** → Default to 1, note "Insufficient data", identify needed evidence
- **Generic persona?** → Go back to interviews, add behavioral details, include direct quotes
- **Overlapping needs?** → Test: "Could I satisfy Need A without Need B?" If no, combine them
- **Over character limit?** → Remove adjectives, convert phrases to words, use active voice

### Before Submission Checklist

✅ Problem statement is solution-neutral
✅ All scores have supporting evidence
✅ Personas include specific behaviors and quotes
✅ Needs are distinct and measurable
✅ All fields within character limits
✅ Users and clients properly distinguished
