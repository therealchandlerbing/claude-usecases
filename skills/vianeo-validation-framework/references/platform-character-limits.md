## Core Business Model Fields

| Field Name | Character Limit | Notes |
|------------|----------------|--------|
| **Project Genesis** | 250 | Origin story, inspiration, or founding context |
| **Problem Statement** | 250 | Clear, solution-neutral problem definition |
| **Field of Application** | 60 | Socio-economic domain or sector |
| **Differentiating Advantages** | 250 | Unique value or barriers to entry |

### Field Descriptions and Usage

#### Project Genesis (250 characters)

**Purpose:** Establish the origin story and founding context for the project.

**What to Include:**
- Inspiration or catalyst for starting the project
- Founding team background or expertise connection
- Problem discovery story
- Unique insight or experience that led to project

**What to Avoid:**
- Generic startup language
- Redundant phrasing
- Solution details (save for other fields)
- Over-explaining the "why now"

**Example (247 characters):**
"After 15 years as a geriatric neurologist, Dr. Santos witnessed families struggling to track cognitive decline between appointments. Traditional assessments require clinic visits and offer only snapshots. She envisioned continuous, home-based monitoring."

---

#### Problem Statement (250 characters)

**Purpose:** Define the core problem being addressed without embedding the solution.

**What to Include:**
- Clear description of the problem
- Who experiences the problem
- Context on urgency or significance
- Impact or consequences of the problem

**What to Avoid:**
- Embedding your solution in the problem description
- Vague language ("many people struggle with...")
- Technical jargon without context
- Multiple unrelated problems

**Format Options:**
1. **Direct Statement:** "Seniors and caregivers lack objective tools to track cognitive decline at home, leading to delayed intervention and missed early treatment windows."
2. **How Might We:** "How might we help caregivers detect early cognitive decline without requiring frequent clinic visits or specialized training?"

**Example (Good - 198 characters):**
"Family caregivers lack tools to objectively track cognitive changes in seniors between medical appointments, resulting in delayed diagnoses and missed opportunities for early intervention."

**Example (Poor - embeds solution):**
"How might we create a mobile app to help seniors maintain cognitive sharpness?" ❌ (Embeds "mobile app" as the solution)

---

#### Field of Application (60 characters)

**Purpose:** Identify the specific socio-economic domain or sector.

**What to Include:**
- Specific sector or domain
- Target geography if relevant
- Context if needed (within character limit)

**What to Avoid:**
- Overly generic terms ("healthcare")
- Overly narrow terms that confuse scope
- Multiple disparate sectors
- Unnecessary adjectives

**Examples:**

| Good Examples (Specific) | Character Count | Why It Works |
|--------------------------|----------------|---------------|
| Senior care in urban areas | 26 | Geographic and demographic specificity |
| Clinical cognitive assessment | 30 | Clear domain and application |
| Hospital-based elderly care | 27 | Setting and population defined |
| Home health monitoring for aging | 32 | Context and sector clear |

| Poor Examples (Too Generic) | Character Count | Why It Fails |
|-----------------------------|----------------|--------------|
| Healthcare | 10 | Far too broad |
| Technology | 10 | No sector context |
| Elderly people | 14 | No sector or application |

---

#### Differentiating Advantages (250 characters)

**Purpose:** Articulate unique value proposition and competitive barriers to entry.

**What to Include:**
- Strongest differentiator first
- Quantification when possible (2x faster, 50% cost reduction)
- Why competitors can't easily replicate
- Evidence if available (validated, patented, exclusive partnership)

**What to Avoid:**
- Generic claims ("better quality," "easier to use")
- Multiple weak differentiators instead of one strong one
- Technical details without context
- Unvalidated claims

**Example (249 characters):**
"Only solution combining clinical-grade assessment with daily home use. Proprietary algorithm validated across 1,200 patients. Exclusive partnership with leading neurology center. 3x more sensitive to early decline than standard screening tools."

**Structure Options:**
1. **Lead with Evidence:** "Validated with 1,200+ patients, our proprietary algorithm detects decline 3x earlier than standard tools. Exclusive partnership with top neurology center creates distribution moat."
2. **Lead with Outcome:** "3x earlier detection of cognitive decline through daily home monitoring. Clinical validation + exclusive distribution = 18-month competitive lead time."

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Pitfall 1: Embedding Solutions in Problem Statements

**Problem (wastes precious characters):**

❌ "How might we create a mobile app to help seniors maintain cognitive sharpness?"
- **Issue:** Embeds "mobile app" as the solution
- **Character count:** 79

✅ "How might we help seniors maintain cognitive sharpness during aging?"
- **Improvement:** Opens space for multiple solution approaches
- **Character count:** 68
- **Savings:** 11 characters

---

### Pitfall 2: Using Vague Language

**Vague Ecosystem Player:**

❌ "Various stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem" (49 chars)
- **Issue:** No specific player identified, wasted entry

✅ "Dr. Sarah Chen, Chief Medical Officer, Regional Health System" (60 chars)
- **Improvement:** Specific, actionable, useful

---

### Pitfall 3: Redundant Phrasing

❌ "In order to help seniors track their cognitive health and maintain their brain function over time..."
- **Issues:** "in order to" → "to" (9 char savings), "track...and maintain" is redundant
- **Character count:** 100

✅ "Help seniors monitor cognitive health over time..."
- **Character count:** 51
- **Savings:** 49 characters

---

### Pitfall 4: Over-Explaining in Short Fields (60-char fields)

**Field of Application:**

❌ "Healthcare sector focused on elderly care and cognitive health" (63 chars)
- **Issue:** Too generic, exceeds limit

✅ "Senior cognitive health monitoring" (34 chars)
- **Improvement:** Specific, clear, well under limit

---

### Pitfall 5: Forgetting to Count Spaces

**Common Mistake:**
- Counting words or characters without spaces
- Spaces count toward character limits
- Always use character count with spaces

**Verification Method:**
Use an online character counter or:
- Word processors: Check "characters (with spaces)"
- Command line: `echo "Your text here" | wc -m`

---

## Field-by-Field Character Strategy

### 60-Character Fields

**Think Twitter-style:** Every word counts

**Strategy:**
1. **Lead with most important information**
2. **Use abbreviations only if universally understood**
3. **Prioritize nouns and verbs** over adjectives
4. **Cut articles (a, an, the) if clear without them**

**Examples:**

| Field | Weak (over limit) | Strong (under limit) |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Field of Application** | "The healthcare sector with a focus on elderly patients" (58) ✅ but weak | "Senior cognitive assessment" (27) ✅ better |
| **Financial Means** | "We have raised $500K from angel investors and have 18 months" (62) ❌ | "$500K seed from angels, 18-mo runway" (38) ✅ |

---

### 250-Character Fields

**Think 2-3 sentences maximum**

**Strategy:**
1. **Use parallel structure** for lists within prose
2. **Frontload the key point**
3. **Remove filler words ruthlessly**
4. **Combine related ideas** into compound sentences

**Template for Problem Statement (250 chars):**
"[User segment] [lacks/struggles with] [specific capability], [resulting in] [consequence]. [Context: scope, urgency, or magnitude]. [Optional: Current solutions are inadequate because...]."

**Example (217 chars):**
"Family caregivers lack objective tools to track cognitive changes in seniors between medical appointments, leading to delayed diagnoses. Current solutions require clinic visits, creating gaps of 3-6 months between assessments."

---

## Emergency Editing Tips

### If Over Limit:

#### Step 1: Remove Adjectives First
- "comprehensive analysis" → "analysis" (14 char savings)
- "very important stakeholders" → "key stakeholders" (11 char savings)

#### Step 2: Convert Phrases to Single Words
- "make a decision" → "decide" (9 char savings)
- "take into consideration" → "consider" (17 char savings)

#### Step 3: Use Active Voice
- "The problem was identified by our team" → "Our team identified the problem" (7 char savings)

#### Step 4: Cut Redundant Information
- "Track and monitor cognitive health over time" → "Track cognitive health over time" (12 char savings)
  - ("Track" and "monitor" are redundant)

#### Step 5: Combine Related Ideas into Compound Sentences
- Before (82 chars): "We have a strong team. Our team has expertise. The team is committed."
- After (54 chars): "Fully committed team with deep expertise."
- **Savings:** 28 characters
