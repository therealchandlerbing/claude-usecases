**Management & Business (Q21-Q32):** Average of 10 questions (Q30-Q31 contextual)
**Commercial (Q33-Q40):** Average of 6 questions (Q33-Q34, Q40 not scored)

### Maturity Level Interpretation

**Overall Score 4.0-5.0:** Advanced maturity - ready for scale or investment
**Overall Score 3.0-3.9:** Moderate maturity - refinement needed before scale
**Overall Score 2.0-2.9:** Early stage - significant development required
**Overall Score 1.0-1.9:** Concept stage - foundational work needed

### Dimensional Balance Assessment

**Well-Balanced Project:** All dimensions within 1 point of each other
**Imbalanced Project:** 2+ point spread between highest and lowest dimension

**Common Patterns:**
- Strong tech, weak commercial = research project not ready for market
- Strong team, weak tech = execution capability but need technical development
- Strong commercial, weak management = opportunity exists but execution risk

### Using This Assessment

**As Diagnostic Tool:**
- Identify specific gaps requiring attention
- Prioritize development activities
- Track progress over time (reassess quarterly)

**As Communication Tool:**

## Best Practices for Completing Assessment

### Evidence-Based Scoring
- Score based on actual evidence, not aspirations
- Default to lower score when uncertain
- Document evidence for scores 4-5
- Note gaps where evidence is missing

### Honest Self-Assessment
- Lower scores identify valuable improvement areas
- Inflated scores lead to poor decision-making
- External validator review recommended
- Reassess after major milestones

### Documentation Standards
- Keep evidence repository alongside scores
- Update quarterly or after major changes
- Track score changes over time
- Share with advisors for validation

### Integration with Other Tools
- Use with 29-Question Market Maturity Assessment for comprehensive view
- Combine with Vianeo Desirability framework for market validation
- Pair with business model canvas for strategic planning
