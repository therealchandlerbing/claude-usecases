# Vianeo Business Validation Framework

**Category:** Research & Validation
**Purpose:** Comprehensive business validation toolkit for conducting validation sprints using the Vianeo platform and methodology
**Framework:** Vianeo 5-Dimension Model (Legitimacy, Desirability, Acceptability, Feasibility, Viability)

---

## Description

The Vianeo Business Validation Framework provides a complete suite of assessment instruments, reference guides, and practical tools for conducting systematic business validation. This framework supports project teams, innovation managers, and startup founders in evaluating market readiness, identifying gaps, and preparing high-quality Vianeo platform submissions.

Unlike generic validation approaches, this framework:
- Provides two complementary assessment instruments (40-question diagnostic + 29-question market maturity)
- Enforces Vianeo 5-dimension structure with clear scoring guidance
- Includes platform-specific constraints (character limits, format requirements)
- Offers practical execution guidance with tested solutions to common pitfalls
- Supplies ready-to-use prioritization tools (Needs Qualification Matrix)

---

## Use Cases

**Primary Use Cases:**
- Conducting comprehensive business validation for innovation projects
- Preparing evidence-based Vianeo platform submissions
- Identifying and prioritizing validation gaps across 5 dimensions
- Systematically assessing project maturity and market readiness
- Executing validation sprints with clear quality standards

**When to Use:**
- "I need to assess our project's readiness for Vianeo submission"
- "Help me identify validation gaps across the 5 Vianeo dimensions"
- "I'm conducting a validation sprint and need guidance on avoiding common pitfalls"
- "I need to prioritize which customer needs to address first"
- "Help me prepare a comprehensive validation assessment with evidence"

**When NOT to Use:**
- For quick stakeholder summaries (use direct analysis instead)
- For persona generation only (use Vianeo Persona Builder instead)
- When no research capacity exists (framework requires evidence gathering)
- For validation frameworks other than Vianeo

## Best Practices

### Assessment Execution

**Do's:**
✅ Complete both assessments (40-Question + 29-Question) for comprehensive view
✅ Score based on actual evidence, not aspirations
✅ Default to conservative scores when uncertain
✅ Document evidence sources for all scores ≥ 4
✅ Re-assess quarterly or after major milestones
✅ Use second reviewer to validate scores
✅ Track improvement over time

**Don'ts:**
❌ Score based on assumptions or optimistic projections
❌ Skip evidence documentation
❌ Inflate scores to look better (hurts strategic planning)
❌ Complete once and never revisit
❌ Work in isolation (get external validation)

---

### Validation Sprint Execution

**Do's:**
✅ Start with assessment to identify gaps
✅ Prioritize critical gaps (dimension scores < 3.0)
✅ Use Sprint Execution Guide to avoid common pitfalls
✅ Conduct sufficient customer interviews (5-10 per segment minimum)
✅ Complete Needs Qualification Matrix for prioritization
✅ Document all evidence systematically

**Don'ts:**
❌ Start validation work without baseline assessment
❌ Try to address all gaps simultaneously (prioritize)
❌ Skip customer interviews (no substitute for direct validation)
❌ Assume needs or pain points (validate with evidence)
❌ Work without quality checklist

---

### Platform Submission

**Do's:**
✅ Review Platform Character Limits before writing
✅ Write comprehensive version first, then edit for constraints
✅ Use provided writing techniques for brevity
✅ Validate character counts before submission
✅ Run through quality checklist
✅ Get peer review before final submission

**Don'ts:**
❌ Write directly to character limits (quality suffers)
❌ Sacrifice critical context for brevity
❌ Use vague language to save characters
❌ Embed solutions in problem statements
❌ Submit without peer review

---

## Documentation Standards

### Evidence Documentation

**For Each Score ≥ 4, Document:**
- Number of customer interviews or data sources
- Specific evidence (quotes, data, documents)
- Validation method (interview, survey, observation, analysis)
- Date of validation (within 6 months preferred)
- Reliability rating (strong/preliminary/hypothesis/unspecified)

**Example Evidence Note:**
> **Q7 Score: 4**
> **Evidence:** Conducted 7 interviews with senior living activities directors (June-July 2025). 6 of 7 expressed need for objective cognitive tracking as "fundamental to medical reporting responsibilities." Current solutions (paper-based games, manual observation) rated "not at all" satisfactory for longitudinal tracking. Interview transcripts available in [evidence folder].
> **Reliability:** More than 5 interviewed

---

### Gap Documentation

**For Each Score < 3, Document:**
- Current score and evidence (if any)
- Target score (e.g., raise from 2 to 4)
- Missing evidence required
- Validation plan (who, what, when)
- Resources needed

**Example Gap Note:**
> **Q19 Score: 2 → Target: 4**
> **Current:** Tested revenue model with 2 customers, mixed feedback
> **Gap:** Need 5-9 customer validations of pricing
> **Plan:** Conduct pricing interviews with 7 additional facility administrators (Weeks 3-5)
> **Resources:** Interview script, pricing validation framework, 10 hours interview time

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue: "Our scores are all 1-2, where do we start?"**
**Solution:**
1. Identify your target Vianeo dimension (which dimension is most important for your project type?)
2. Within that dimension, identify 2-3 questions to address first
3. Design targeted research for those specific questions
4. Use Sprint Execution Guide for quality standards
5. Re-assess after addressing those 2-3 questions

**Issue: "We're stuck at score 3, how do we get to 4?"**
**Solution:**
- Score 3 → 4 requires more validation sources (from 3-4 to 5-9 interviews typically)
- Review scoring criteria for the specific question
- Identify what evidence is missing (usually quantification or external validation)
- Conduct additional targeted research
- Use Needs Qualification Matrix to strengthen Desirability evidence

**Issue: "Our team scores the same question differently"**
**Solution:**
- Indicates lack of calibration on evidence standards
- Review Sprint Execution Guide scoring criteria together
- Discuss specific evidence for the question
- Agree on evidence standard as a team
- Document standard for future consistency

**Issue: "We're over character limits for platform submission"**
**Solution:**
- See Platform Character Limits - Emergency Editing Tips
- Remove adjectives first
- Convert phrases to single words
- Use active voice
- Cut redundant information
- DO NOT sacrifice critical context
