# 360 Content Converter

Transform one piece of content into multiple platform-optimized formats while maintaining brand consistency, strategic coherence, and cultural awareness.

## When to Trigger This Skill

Activate when the user:
- Asks to repurpose, adapt, transform, or convert content across platforms
- Mentions creating content for multiple channels from a single source
- Needs platform-specific versions (social, email, podcast, video, etc.)
- Requests multi-language content adaptation
- Wants to maximize content reach or efficiency
- Says "convert this to..." or "create versions for..."

## Core Capabilities

### Platform Coverage

**Social Media**
- LinkedIn (posts, carousels, articles, newsletters)
- Twitter/X (threads, standalone tweets, quote tweets)
- Instagram (captions, Stories scripts, Reels scripts)
- Facebook (organic posts, ads)
- YouTube (video scripts, descriptions, community posts)
- TikTok (video scripts, captions)

**Professional/Business**
- Email sequences (nurture, newsletter, promotional)
- Blog posts (long-form, short-form, SEO-optimized)
- Case studies
- Whitepapers
- Presentations (PowerPoint, Google Slides, Keynote)
- Webinar scripts
- Podcast outlines and talking points

**Visual/Design**
- Infographic outlines (with design specifications)
- One-pagers
- Pitch decks
- Slide carousels
- Video storyboards

**Specialized**
- Press releases
- Media kits
- Investor updates
- Grant narratives
- Partner communications

### Multi-Language Support

**Primary Languages**
- English (US, UK, International)
- Portuguese (Brazilian, European)
- Spanish (Latin American, European)

**Approach**
- Never direct translate. Adapt for cultural context and platform norms in each language.
- Portuguese for Brazil: warmer, more relationship-focused tone. Business relationships develop slower.
- Spanish for Latin America: respect hierarchy, use formal address until invited otherwise.
- Maintain brand voice across languages while adapting to cultural expectations.

## Platform-Specific Best Practices

### LinkedIn

**Format Requirements**
- Posts: 150-300 words for optimal engagement (can go longer for thought leadership)
- First 2 lines must hook (shows before "see more")
- Carousels: 8-12 slides maximum, title slide + conclusion slide required
- Use line breaks generously (improves readability on mobile)

**Tone**
- Professional but conversational
- Lead with insight, not promotion
- Use "you" language to engage directly
- Stories and specific examples perform better than abstract concepts

**Structure**
- Hook (question, surprising stat, bold statement)
- Context/problem
- Insight/solution
- Specific example or data
- Takeaway or call to engage

**Design Specs for Carousels**
- Dimensions: 1080 x 1080px per slide
- Safe zone: 100px margin on all sides
- Typography: Clear hierarchy (40-60pt headers, 24-32pt body)
- Brand colors: Use consistently across slides
- One core idea per slide
- Conclusion slide: Recap key points + CTA

### Twitter/X

**Format Requirements**
- Threads: 8-15 tweets optimal (not too short, not overwhelming)
- Each tweet: 200-280 characters (leave room for engagement)
- Hook tweet must work standalone (people RT without reading thread)
- Number tweets if educational (1/, 2/, etc.)

**Tone**
- Direct and confident
- Conversational but substantive
- Okay to be provocative (if authentic)
- Use plain language, avoid jargon

**Structure**
- Tweet 1: Hook (stop the scroll)
- Tweet 2: Setup the problem/context
- Tweets 3-N: Build momentum with specific insights
- Final tweet: Synthesis + optional CTA
- Use transitions between tweets ("Here's why:", "The problem:", "What this means:")

### Email Sequences

**Format Requirements**
- Subject line: 40 characters or fewer (mobile preview)
- Preview text: First 85-100 characters visible
- Body: 150-300 words per email (unless long-form newsletter)
- Clear single CTA per email

**Sequence Structure (5-Email Nurture Example)**
- Email 1: Introduce problem (empathy + recognition)
- Email 2: Deepen problem (why it matters, what's at stake)
- Email 3: Introduce solution (framework, not pitch)
- Email 4: Proof (case study, data, testimonial)
- Email 5: Clear next step (soft CTA)

**Tone**
- Conversational and personal
- One-to-one feel (even if sent to thousands)
- Use "you" and "I" language
- Scan-friendly (short paragraphs, bullets when helpful)

### Blog Posts

**Format Requirements**
- SEO title: 50-60 characters
- Meta description: 150-160 characters
- Structure with H2/H3 headers (aids SEO and scannability)
- 1,200-2,000 words for evergreen content
- 600-1,000 words for timely content

**Structure**
- Compelling title (clear benefit or intrigue)
- Opening hook (2-3 sentences max)
- Context (why this matters now)
- Core content (chunked with subheads)
- Examples or case studies
- Actionable takeaways
- Conclusion with CTA

**SEO Considerations**
- Primary keyword in title, first paragraph, one H2
- Internal links to related content
- External links to credible sources
- Alt text for images
- URL slug (short, keyword-focused)

### Presentations

**Format Requirements**
- One idea per slide (avoid clutter)
- 6 x 6 rule: No more than 6 bullets, 6 words per bullet
- High-contrast text (dark on light or light on dark)
- Consistent template across slides

**Structure**
- Title slide
- Agenda/roadmap (optional, depending on length)
- Problem/opportunity
- Core content (chunked into clear sections)
- Evidence/proof
- Implications/so what
- Next steps/CTA
- Conclusion/contact

**Design Specs**
- 16:9 aspect ratio (standard)
- Brand colors throughout
- Typography hierarchy (titles 28-44pt, body 18-24pt)
- Generous margins (80-100px)
- Consistent alignment
- Visual variety (mix text slides with image slides, data viz)

## Strategic Analysis Features

### Content-Platform Fit Analysis
Before converting, analyze:
- Which platforms will perform best for this content type
- What adaptation depth is needed (light edit vs. complete restructure)
- What's missing for specific platforms (data, visuals, CTAs)
- Where this fits in broader content strategy

### Audience Adaptation
- Technical vs. general audiences
- B2B vs. B2C
- Geographic/cultural considerations
- Stakeholder level (executive, practitioner, community)

### Timing and Sequencing
- Recommend publishing order across platforms
- Identify content that needs platform-specific timing
- Flag seasonal or time-sensitive elements

## Workflow Process

### 1. Analyze Source Content
- Identify core narrative and key insights
- Extract specific examples, data, stories
- Determine content type and goals
- Note brand voice patterns

### 2. Platform Strategy
- Recommend optimal platforms based on content type and goals
- Prioritize platforms by strategic value
- Identify resource requirements
- Suggest publishing sequence

### 3. Generate Platform Versions
- Create optimized version for each platform
- Maintain brand voice consistency
- Adapt tone and format to platform norms
- Include platform-specific CTAs

### 4. Design Specifications (When Needed)
- Provide detailed specs for visual content
- Include dimensions, colors, typography
- Specify layout and hierarchy
- Add accessibility requirements

### 5. Quality Checks
- Verify brand voice consistency across platforms
- Check all platform requirements met
- Ensure strategic alignment
- Validate cultural appropriateness (multi-language)

## Output Standards

### Always Include
- Platform-optimized formatting
- Character/word counts
- Specific CTAs (adapted per platform)
- Brand voice consistency
- Cultural/language adaptation where relevant
- Design specifications (when applicable)
- Strategic rationale (why this approach for this platform)

### Deliverable Format
Create interactive artifact with:
- Tabbed or sectioned view of all outputs
- Easy navigation between platforms
- Clear labels (platform-language-version)
- Ready to copy/export individual versions

### Quality Thresholds

**Ready to Publish**
- No placeholder text
- All links/CTAs functional
- Brand voice consistent
- Platform requirements met
- Proofread (no typos, grammar issues)

**Needs Review**
- Outline or draft stage
- Requires user input (data, links, images)
- Multiple strategic options presented
- Awaiting brand approval

## Multi-Language Guidelines

### Portuguese (Brazilian) Specific
- Warmer, relationship-focused tone (if appropriate)
- Business context acknowledged (relationships before contracts)
- Formal vs. informal "you" (você vs. tu) used correctly
- Brazilian examples/references (not Portugal)

### Spanish (Latin American) Specific
- Respects organizational hierarchy
- Formal address unless invited otherwise
- Clear mutual benefits emphasized
- Regional variations considered (Mexico vs. Argentina, etc.)

### Cultural Adaptation Process
1. Understand the concept in target language/culture
2. Identify culturally appropriate examples and references
3. Adapt tone and formality to cultural norms
4. Rebuild content with cultural intelligence
5. Avoid direct word-for-word translation

## Strategic Decision Framework

### High-Value Platform Matches

**Long-form content → Blog, LinkedIn Article, Email sequence**
**Data/research → Infographic, LinkedIn Carousel, Twitter thread**
**Narrative/story → Podcast, Video script, Blog post**
**Quick insight → Twitter, LinkedIn post, Instagram**
**Visual concept → Instagram, TikTok, Infographic**
**Professional insight → LinkedIn, Email, Whitepaper**

### Platform Synergies

These work well together:
- Blog post + LinkedIn article + Email sequence
- Twitter thread + LinkedIn carousel + Infographic
- Podcast + Blog post + Twitter thread
- Video script + Blog post + Social clips

### Resource Considerations

**Low lift:** Twitter, LinkedIn post, Email
**Medium lift:** Blog, Carousel, Podcast outline
**High lift:** Video, Infographic (requires design), Presentation

## Common Patterns and Solutions

### Source content is too long
Extract core narrative arc. Identify 3-5 key insights. Build each platform version around one insight (not trying to include everything).

### Source content is too technical
Create accessibility ladder. Most technical version for specialized platforms (whitepaper, technical blog). Mid-level for professional platforms (LinkedIn). Simplified for general social (Instagram, Twitter).

### Maintaining authenticity across platforms
Keep core message and examples consistent. Adapt tone and length to platform. Use same stories, just told differently.

### Too many platforms requested
Use strategic decision tree. Recommend 3-5 primary platforms based on goals. Deprioritize platforms where audience overlap is minimal or resource cost is high. Quality over quantity.

### Multi-language loses nuance
Don't translate directly. Start by understanding the concept in target language/culture. What examples resonate there? What references work? Rebuild content with cultural intelligence.

## Critical Rules

### Always Do
- Read source content thoroughly before converting
- Analyze brand voice from examples if provided
- Recommend strategic platform prioritization
- Create interactive artifact for easy review
- Provide individual files for each output
- Include design specifications when relevant
- Adapt for cultural context in multi-language work
- Give strategic rationale for approach

### Never Do
- Generic, templated outputs
- Force all content onto all platforms
- Direct word-for-word translation
- Skip brand voice analysis if examples provided
- Ignore cultural context
- Provide incomplete specifications
- Overwhelm with too many options without prioritization

### When Uncertain
- Ask clarifying questions before starting
- Provide 2-3 strategic options with tradeoffs
- Flag what would improve output quality (more context, examples, etc.)
- Recommend starting with fewer platforms and expanding
- Suggest testing one platform approach before scaling
