### Platform Elimination Method

**Eliminate platforms that**:
❌ Your audience doesn't use
❌ You can't commit to consistently
❌ Don't align with content type
❌ Require resources you don't have
❌ Haven't performed historically (if you have data)
❌ Don't serve your strategic goals
❌ Create more work than value

**What's left = Your priority platforms**

---

## STRATEGIC SEQUENCING

### Publishing Order Recommendations

**Owned channels first**:
1. Blog/Website
2. Email to subscribers

**Professional platforms next**:
3. LinkedIn (Article or Post)

**Social amplification last**:
4. Twitter
5. Instagram
6. Other social

**Why this order**:
- Ensures content lives on platforms you own
- Drives traffic to owned channels
- Builds SEO value
- Email subscribers get first access

---

## TESTING & OPTIMIZATION

### How to Test Platform Strategy

**Start small**:
1. Choose 2-3 platforms you think will work
2. Publish consistently for 8-12 weeks
3. Track performance metrics
4. Double down on what works, deprioritize what doesn't

**Metrics that matter**:
- Engagement rate (not just volume)
- Quality of audience (not just size)
- Conversions (if applicable)
- Effort vs. impact ratio

---

### When to Add Platforms

**Add new platform when**:
✅ Existing platforms running smoothly
✅ Have capacity to maintain quality
✅ Clear audience on new platform
✅ Strategic reason (not just "should be there")
✅ Can commit for 3+ months

**Don't add platform when**:
❌ Struggling with current platforms
❌ No clear audience or strategy
❌ Just because competitors are there
❌ Can't maintain consistency

---

### When to Drop Platforms

**Consider dropping when**:
- Consistently underperforming (3+ months)
- Audience not engaging
- Too much effort for little impact
- Strategic priorities shifted
- Better opportunities elsewhere

**Before dropping**:
- Try optimizing
- Check if you're using platform correctly
- Ask audience if they value it
- Test lower frequency vs. abandoning

---

## FINAL STRATEGIC PRINCIPLES

### Quality Over Quantity
Better to do 2 platforms excellently than 6 platforms poorly.

### Consistency Over Perfection
Regular decent content beats occasional perfect content.

### Audience Over Algorithms
Serve your audience first. Platforms reward that eventually.

### Owned Over Rented
Prioritize email and blog (you own). Social is amplification.

### Strategy Over Tactics
Know why you're on each platform. "Everyone's there" isn't a strategy.

### Testing Over Assumptions
Your audience may surprise you. Test and learn.

### Focus Over FOMO
You don't need to be everywhere. Be strategic about where you invest.
