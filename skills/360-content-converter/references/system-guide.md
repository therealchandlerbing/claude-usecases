- Evaluating past performance

**How it works**:

## Troubleshooting

### "Claude's Output Feels Generic"

**Fixes**:
1. Provide more specific examples in your prompt
2. Attach brand voice samples
3. Include actual data and stories (not just summaries)
4. Be specific about what makes your voice unique

**Root cause**: Claude needs more context about your brand voice and specifics.

---

### "Wrong Platforms Recommended"

**Fixes**:
1. Be more specific about your goals and audience in prompt
2. Use Template 6 (Platform Strategy First)
3. Review Platform Strategy Decision Tree yourself first
4. Provide examples of what has worked well before

**Root cause**: Unclear goals or audience definition.

---

### "Multi-Language Version Doesn't Feel Right"

**Fixes**:
1. Add more cultural context to prompt
2. Don't ask for translation, ask for cultural adaptation
3. Get native speaker review
4. Provide examples of good localization

**Root cause**: Translation vs. adaptation. Always choose adaptation.

---

### "Too Much Content, Can't Use It All"

**Fixes**:
1. Use Platform Strategy Decision Tree to prioritize
2. Start with 2-3 platforms, expand only if capacity allows
3. Use "Low Resources" pathway
4. Focus on owned channels + one amplification channel

**Root cause**: Trying to do too much. Quality over quantity.
