## Customization Tips

### Making Templates Your Own

1. **Save your frequently used configurations**: Create a saved version of templates with your common settings pre-filled.

2. **Add your brand voice shorthand**: Instead of describing your voice each time, create a reference document and point to it.

3. **Build platform combinations**: Create custom templates for your specific platform combinations.

4. **Team delegation versions**: Add delegation instructions to templates for team handoff.

### Template Variables to Customize

Replace these placeholders:

- `[content type]`: blog post, whitepaper, presentation, research report, announcement
- `[Platform X]`: LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, email, blog, podcast
- `[stakeholder type]`: investors, partners, community members, team, board
- `[target language]`: Portuguese (Brazilian), Spanish (Latin American)
- `[target market]`: Brazil, Mexico, LATAM, Europe
- `[audience description]`: technical experts, general public, executives, practitioners
- `[brand voice]`: conversational but substantive, authoritative, warm and accessible
- `[hex codes]`: Your brand color codes
- `[fonts]`: Your brand typography

---

## Troubleshooting Templates

**Template output is too generic**
- Add more specific examples to your prompt
- Include actual brand voice samples
- Give more context about your audience and goals

**Wrong platforms recommended**
- Use Template 6 (Platform Strategy First)
- Be more specific about goals and audience
- Provide examples of what has worked well

**Multi-language version feels off**
- Add more cultural context to your prompt
- Specify relationship dynamics (formal/informal)
- Include examples of good translations

**Design specs aren't detailed enough**
- Use Template 15 (Design-Spec Package)
- Attach brand guidelines or examples
- Specify what designer should deliver

**Need faster turnaround**
- Use simpler templates (Template 2 for social only)
- Reduce number of platforms
- Focus on highest-priority outputs first
