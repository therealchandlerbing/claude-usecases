# 360 Content Converter: Quality Control Checklist

## How to Use This Checklist

**Purpose**: Ensure content is ready to publish before it goes live. Catch issues that would undermine credibility, confuse audiences, or waste effort.

**When to use**:
- Before publishing any converted content
- Before handing off to team members for execution
- After making revisions based on feedback
- Before translation or multi-language publication

**How to use**:
1. Start with "Critical Issues" (must fix before publishing)
2. Move to "Platform-Specific Checks" (varies by channel)
3. Finish with "Strategic Alignment" (does this serve your goals)
4. For team delegation, assign different sections to different roles

## COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

### Issue: Content feels generic
**Fix**: Add specific examples, data, or stories from source material. Remove vague language.

### Issue: Platform adaptation isn't working
**Fix**: Review platform-specific best practices above. Check character limits, formatting requirements, tone expectations.

### Issue: Multi-language version misses the mark
**Fix**: Cultural adaptation needed, not just translation. Consult native speaker. Localize examples and references.

### Issue: Design specs unclear
**Fix**: Add visual references. Specify measurements exactly. Describe hierarchy in spatial terms.

### Issue: Too long/too short
**Fix**: Check platform requirements above. Edit for platform (don't just cut). Ensure core message intact.

### Issue: Doesn't sound like brand
**Fix**: Compare to best brand examples. Identify what's off. Revise specific elements rather than starting over.

### Issue: CTA unclear or weak
**Fix**: Make CTA specific and singular. What's the one thing you want people to do? Make it easy and clear.

### Issue: Breaking platform rules
**Fix**: Review platform-specific checklists above. Test on actual platform before publishing at scale.
