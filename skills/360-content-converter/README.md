## Best Practices

### Content Quality
1. Provide source content with context (why it matters, audience, goals)
2. Include brand voice examples if available
3. Specify any must-include elements (data, quotes, CTAs)
4. Note what can be cut vs. what's essential

### Platform Selection
1. Use strategic decision tree when unsure
2. Start with 2-3 platforms, expand if capacity allows
3. Prioritize owned channels (blog, email) + amplification (social)
4. Match platform to content type (data → infographic, story → podcast)

### Multi-Language Projects
1. Always provide cultural context, not just language
2. Specify relationship dynamics (formal/informal, warm/professional)
3. Include local examples when possible
4. Get native speaker review before publishing (ideal)

### Quality Control
1. Use checklist before publishing anything
2. Verify brand voice consistency across all versions
3. Check platform requirements met
4. Test links and CTAs
5. Proofread (typos undermine credibility)

## Integration with Other Skills

### Design Director
For visual content (infographics, presentations, carousels), use Design Director to:
- Elevate design quality to professional standards
- Apply contemporary design best practices
- Ensure accessibility (WCAG AA)
- Match design to audience and purpose

**Workflow:** Content Converter creates content + specs → Design Director elevates visual execution

### Intelligence Extractor
For partnership/stakeholder communications from meeting intelligence:
- Extract intelligence from meetings
- Convert to stakeholder updates across platforms
- Adapt for different audiences (internal, partners, public)

**Workflow:** Intelligence Extractor captures insights → Content Converter distributes across channels

### Newsletter Generator
For multi-channel distribution from newsletter content:
- Generate newsletter
- Repurpose key stories across social platforms
- Create email sequences from newsletter themes

**Workflow:** Newsletter Generator creates comprehensive update → Content Converter amplifies across platforms

## Advanced Features

### A/B Testing Variations
Generate multiple versions for testing:
```
Create 3 subject line variations for this email (safe, provocative, data-driven)
```

### Audience Segmentation
Adapt single source for multiple audiences:
```
Convert this technical report for: 1) executives (strategic), 2) practitioners (detailed), 3) general public (accessible)
```

### Performance Optimization
Based on analytics:
```
My Twitter threads perform better than LinkedIn posts. Focus content there and create supporting LinkedIn posts to drive traffic.
```

### Seasonal/Contextual Adaptation
```
Adapt this evergreen content for Q4 giving season, emphasize impact and urgency
```

## Troubleshooting

### Output feels generic
**Fix:** Provide more specific examples, actual data points, brand voice samples

### Wrong platforms recommended
**Fix:** Be more specific about goals and audience, use strategic decision tree

### Multi-language version doesn't resonate
**Fix:** Add cultural context, relationship dynamics, local examples. Get native speaker review.

### Too much content, can't use it all
**Fix:** Use platform strategy decision tree to prioritize. Start with 2-3 platforms. Quality over quantity.

### Design specs unclear
**Fix:** Use design-spec template, provide visual examples, specify exact measurements and colors
