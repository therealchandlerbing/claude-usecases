# Vianeo Persona Builder

Create Vianeo-aligned personas with pains, gains, JTBD, and messaging guidance for product discovery.

## How to Use
1. Specify the market segment, product, and outcome you are validating.
2. Provide any research notes, interviews, or survey snippets.
3. Request the number of personas and preferred fidelity (brief vs. full canvas).

## Outputs
- Persona profiles with context, pains, gains, and JTBD
- Adoption blockers and validation experiments
- Messaging drafts tailored to the persona

## Tips
- Include stage of company or product to tune maturity assumptions.
- Share known objections or procurement constraints to pre-empt blockers.
