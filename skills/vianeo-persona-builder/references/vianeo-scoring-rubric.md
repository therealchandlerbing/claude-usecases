# Vianeo Persona Scoring Rubric

This document provides the detailed scoring criteria used by the Vianeo Persona Builder skill to assess persona quality and predict Vianeo Desirability scores.

---

## Overview

Vianeo uses a 1-5 scale to assess the Desirability dimension, which includes persona quality. The Persona Builder skill analyzes personas against these criteria and provides predicted scores with justification.

**Score Range:**
- **5 = Exceptional:** Deeply validated, highly specific, clearly distinct personas
- **4 = Strong:** Well-validated with good specificity and clear differentiation
- **3 = Adequate:** Basic validation with reasonable detail and some distinction
- **2 = Weak:** Limited validation, generic details, significant gaps
- **1 = Critical Gap:** No validation, hypothetical, no meaningful distinction

---

## Score 5: Exceptional Personas

### Validation Evidence
**Interview Count:** 10+ validated interviews per persona
- Each persona based on substantial, diverse evidence
- Multiple data sources corroborate patterns
- High confidence in representativeness

**Quote Quality:**
- Direct quotes available for all major claims
- Source attribution for every quote
- Quotes demonstrate depth and context
- Evidence repository is comprehensive

**Pattern Validation:**
- Key patterns confirmed across majority of sources (75%+ of interviews)
- Consensus clearly established
- Outliers identified and explained
- Behavioral observations supplement self-reports

### Persona Specificity

**Behavioral Detail:**

- Activities include specific metrics (e.g., "manages 47 projects," "spends 10-12 hours weekly")
- Current solutions name actual products/services with version/feature details
- Decision-making processes clearly documented with triggers and criteria

**Distinctiveness:**
- Each persona clearly distinct with non-overlapping needs
- Different pain points, tasks, and current solutions per persona

- Detailed gap analysis explaining why current solutions fail
- Workarounds documented with reasons
- Clear understanding of competitive/alternative landscape

### Structural Completeness

**All Four Layers:**

## Common Quality Issues and Fixes

### Issue: Generic Pain Points
**Example:** "Frustrated with inefficiency"
**Fix:** "Spends 15 hours weekly on manual status reports that could be automated"
**How to Get There:** Ask "How much time does this take?" and "How often does this happen?"

---

### Issue: Solution-Focused Needs
**Example:** "Needs an AI-powered dashboard"
**Fix:** "Needs to identify at-risk projects 2 weeks earlier to prevent failures"
**How to Get There:** Ask "What outcome are you trying to achieve?" not "What features do you want?"

---

### Issue: Overlapping Personas
**Example:** Two personas with identical task lists
**Fix:** Identify truly distinct segments or consolidate
**How to Get There:** Map all needs across personas; if 70%+ overlap, consolidate

---

### Issue: Vague Current Solutions
**Example:** "Uses various tools"
**Fix:** "Uses Asana for task tracking, Excel for reporting, and Slack for updates, but manually synchronizes between them"
**How to Get There:** Ask "Walk me through exactly what you use now and where it breaks down"

---

### Issue: Missing Quantification
**Example:** "Coordination takes too long"
**Fix:** "Partnership approval takes 6-8 weeks vs. desired 2-3 weeks"
**How to Get There:** Ask "How long does this take now? How long should it take?"

---

### Issue: Assumed Internal Experience
**Example:** "Probably feels overwhelmed by complexity"
**Fix:** Direct quote: "I feel like I need a PhD in partnership law just to get started"
**How to Get There:** Conduct interviews asking "How do you feel about..." and "What goes through your mind when..."

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I submit personas that score 2-3?**
A: Yes, but they're less competitive. Score 3 is adequate, 4+ is strong.

**Q: How many interviews do I really need?**
A: For Score 4-5: 5-10+ per persona. For Score 3: 3-5. Below 3: Score 2 or less.

**Q: What if I can't get more interviews?**
A: Use behavioral data and observations to supplement, but mark as inferred. Be realistic about score expectations.

**Q: Can I improve a Score 2 to Score 4 quickly?**
A: Likely requires 10-15 additional interviews plus analysis time. Plan 4-6 weeks minimum.

**Q: Do all personas need the same evidence level?**
A: No, but weaker personas pull down overall score. Aim for consistency.

**Q: What if my personas overlap?**
A: Either differentiate them more clearly or consolidate. Overlap indicates over-segmentation.

**Q: How important are direct quotes?**
A: Very important for Score 4-5. They provide evidence and authenticity.

**Q: Can I use secondary research?**
A: Yes, but mark as inferred. Primary research (interviews) required for high scores.
