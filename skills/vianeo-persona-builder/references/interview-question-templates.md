# Interview Question Templates for Persona Validation

This guide provides structured interview questions aligned with the Vianeo four-layer persona structure. Use these templates to conduct validation research that generates high-quality persona data.

## Interview Structure Overview

**Recommended Format:**
- Duration: 45-60 minutes
- Style: Semi-structured (use these as guides, not scripts)
- Recording: Yes (with permission) for accurate quotes
- Follow-up: Ask "tell me more" and "can you give an example" frequently

**Key Principles:**
- Ask about behaviors and experiences, not preferences
- Seek specific examples and stories
- Quantify whenever possible (time, frequency, cost)
- Explore current solutions and why they fail
- Focus on problems, not your solution

## Interview Techniques

### Getting Specific Examples

**Instead of hypotheticals:**
- ❌ "What would you do if...?"
- ✅ "Tell me about the last time this happened. What did you do?"

**Instead of generalizations:**
- ❌ "How do you usually handle that?"
- ✅ "Walk me through the most recent time you dealt with this."

### Quantifying Pain Points

**Always ask for numbers:**
- "How much time does that take?" (get to specific hours/minutes)
- "How often does that happen?" (weekly, monthly, per project)
- "What does it cost when that goes wrong?" (money, time, opportunities)
- "How many times have you seen this?" (get frequency)

### Getting Past Surface Answers

**When you hear vague responses:**
- "Can you give me a specific example?"
- "Tell me more about that."
- "Walk me through exactly what that looks like."
- "What does that mean specifically?"

### Exploring Current Solutions Deeply

**Multi-layer questioning:**
1. "What do you use for [task]?"
2. "How exactly do you use it?"
3. "What doesn't work about it?"
4. "Can you give me an example of when it failed?"
5. "What workarounds have you created?"
6. "Why haven't you switched to something else?"
