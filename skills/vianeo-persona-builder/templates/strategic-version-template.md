## Quality Assessment

### Predicted Vianeo Score: [1-5]

**Justification:**
[Detailed explanation of why this score was assigned based on the Vianeo rubric. Reference interview counts, specificity, distinctiveness, current solution analysis, etc.]

### Strength Analysis

**What's Working Well:**
- [Strength 1: e.g., "Strong behavioral detail from 8 interviews per persona"]
- [Strength 2: e.g., "Clear distinctiveness between partner segments"]
- [Strength 3: e.g., "Excellent current solution documentation"]
- [Additional strengths...]

**Evidence Quality:**
- Interview Count: [Total / Average per persona]

- [Gap 2: e.g., "Need 3-4 more interviews to reach Score 5"]
- [Gap 3: e.g., "Some overlap between Personas 3 and 4 in task lists"]
- [Additional gaps...]

**Research Needs:**
- [Specific area]: Needs [X] additional interviews focused on [topic]
- [Another area]: Requires validation of [specific hypothesis]
- [Additional research needs...]

### Distinctiveness Check

**Persona Overlap Analysis:**
- Personas [X] and [Y]: [No overlap / Minor overlap in [area] / Significant overlap - recommend consolidation]
- Personas [A] and [B]: [Assessment]
- [Additional comparisons...]

**Recommendation:** [Keep all personas / Consolidate X and Y / Further differentiation needed]

### Recommendations for Improvement

**To Reach Score [X+1]:**
1. [Specific action 1: e.g., "Conduct 3 additional interviews with innovators focusing on current solution gaps"]
2. [Specific action 2: e.g., "Quantify the time/cost impact for pain points in Persona 2"]
3. [Specific action 3: e.g., "Differentiate Personas 3 and 4 by exploring their distinct decision-making processes"]
4. [Additional recommendations...]

**Priority Actions:**
- **High Priority:** [Action that would most improve score]
- **Medium Priority:** [Secondary improvements]
- **Low Priority:** [Nice-to-have enhancements]

**Expected Impact:**
- Implementing high priority actions: Could improve to Score [X]
- Full implementation: Could achieve Score [X]
