# Example: Innovator Persona (Inferred)

This example demonstrates an inferred innovator persona generated from project documentation and behavioral data without direct interviews. This illustrates what happens when validation research hasn't yet been conducted.

---

## Persona: Dr. Carlos

**Type:** Innovator
**Validation Status:** ⚠️ Inferred - Needs Validation (Score 2)
**Sources:** 4 validation reports, Asana project data, email patterns, no interviews
**Geographic Context:** Brazil, biotech sector

---

### Layer 1: Requester (Who They Are)

**Name:** Carlos
**Age:** 38

**Life / Motivations:** ⚠️ INFERRED
Carlos is a biotech researcher at a federal university working on diagnostic technologies for infectious diseases. Based on his validation submissions and project timelines, he appears motivated by translating academic research into practical tools for underserved communities. His project documentation suggests he's balancing research responsibilities with commercialization efforts, though the specific drivers for this transition aren't fully understood without direct conversation.

**Personality / Values:** ⚠️ INFERRED
Email communication patterns suggest Carlos is detail-oriented (lengthy, thorough messages with multiple questions) and prefers asynchronous communication (emails over calls). His Asana engagement shows consistent follow-through on tasks but questions tend to cluster near deadlines, potentially indicating he batches validation work rather than working continuously. Values appear to include scientific rigor and social impact based on project documentation language, but this needs validation through direct discussion.

**Evidence Notes:**
- No interview validation yet
- Patterns inferred from 47 email exchanges over 8 months
- Asana engagement: 89 task completions, avg response time 3.2 days
- RESEARCH GAP: Need to validate motivations, understand what drives commercialization interest, explore personality traits through conversation

---

### Layer 2: Field of Application (Their World)

**Thinks / Feels:** ⚠️ HYPOTHESIS
Likely feels pressure to demonstrate research impact beyond publications, possibly driven by university or funding requirements. May experience uncertainty about commercial processes given question patterns in validation submissions. Probably concerned about resource limitations based on budget questions in validation reports. *These are hypotheses requiring validation.*

**Observes:** ⚠️ HYPOTHESIS
Validation documents suggest awareness that similar diagnostic tools fail in field conditions despite lab success. Project descriptions mention observing challenges in rural healthcare settings, indicating some field exposure. Likely notices disconnect between academic research cycles and market timelines. *Observational context needs direct validation.*

**Does:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY VALIDATED
Asana data shows Carlos conducts laboratory research 3-4 days weekly, attends administrative meetings (avg 3/month based on calendar patterns), and engages with validation processes in focused bursts (completes 5-10 validation tasks, then pauses for 2-3 weeks). Email timestamps suggest he works on commercialization activities in evenings and weekends rather than during regular work hours. *Behavioral patterns observed but context and reasoning need validation.*

**Others Say:** ⚠️ NO DATA
No third-party feedback available. Need to interview collaborators, students, or validation program staff for external perspectives.

**Evidence Notes:**
- Email timestamp pattern: 67% of commercialization emails sent after 6pm or weekends
- Asana burst pattern: avg 5-10 tasks completed, then 2-3 week gap
- RESEARCH GAP: All "thinks/feels" content is hypothesis. Need 5-7 interviews to validate internal experience. Need colleague/student feedback for "others say."

### Layer 3: Activities and Challenges (What They Do and Struggle With)

**Tasks / Activities:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY VALIDATED
- Conducts laboratory research on diagnostic assays (inferred from project docs and Asana research tasks)
- Writes and submits academic papers and grant proposals (3 submissions noted in validation docs)
- Manages graduate student research projects (2 students mentioned in documentation)
- Completes validation assessments and milestone reports (4 completed, data from Asana)
- Attends partnership meetings and pitch sessions (calendar shows 6 such events in 8 months)
- Engages with potential manufacturing partners (3 mentioned in validation reports)

*These tasks inferred from observable data but need validation of priority, time allocation, and experience.*

**Pains / Lacks:** ⚠️ HYPOTHESIS
- Appears to struggle with validation process complexity based on repeated questions about requirements and timelines
- Likely lacks commercialization expertise given questions about market sizing and business models
- May face time constraints (weekend work pattern suggests commercialization is extra burden)
- Possibly experiences resource limitations (budget concerns in 3 of 4 validation reports)
- Might struggle to find manufacturing partners (partnership search mentioned across 6-month period)
- Could lack clarity on next steps post-validation (questions about "what happens after validation")

*All pain points are hypotheses inferred from question patterns and behaviors. None directly stated or validated.*

**Expectations / Hopes:** ⚠️ HYPOTHESIS
- Likely wants clearer guidance on commercialization pathway steps
- Probably hopes for connections to manufacturing partners in Brazil
- May expect validation process to lead directly to funding or partnerships
- Possibly wants to maintain research focus while advancing commercialization
- Might hope for streamlined processes that require less time investment
- Could expect support with business and market aspects unfamiliar to academics

*All expectations inferred from question patterns and project documentation language. Need interview validation.*

**Evidence Notes:**
- Question patterns analyzed from 4 validation submissions
- Repeated questions about: timeline (4x), partner connections (3x), funding (4x), next steps (3x)
- RESEARCH GAP: Major gap - no direct statements of pains or hopes. Need 5-7 interviews asking "What's your biggest frustration with..." and "What would success look like..."

### Layer 4: Current Solutions (Their Present Reality)

**Current Solutions:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY VALIDATED
Validation documents indicate Carlos currently uses university lab facilities for research and has applied for FAPESP funding for commercialization support. Project documentation mentions informal conversations with two potential manufacturing partners but no formal agreements in place. The validation program itself appears to be his primary commercialization support structure. What's unclear is what tools, processes, or resources he used before joining the validation program, why those were insufficient, and what specific gaps remain.

**Evidence Notes:**
- FAPESP application mentioned in validation report 2
- Two manufacturing partners named in documentation but relationship status unclear
- RESEARCH GAP: Don't know what he tried before, why current approaches are inadequate, what workarounds he's using, or what he wishes existed. Need interviews exploring current solution journey.

## Why This Is a Weak Persona (Score 2)

**Weaknesses:**
1. **No Interview Validation:** All insights inferred from behaviors and documents, not validated through conversation
2. **Hypothetical Pains/Hopes:** Pain points are guesses based on questions asked, not directly stated frustrations
3. **Missing Internal Experience:** No access to what Carlos actually thinks, feels, or observes in his world
4. **No External Perspectives:** Don't know how colleagues, students, or partners perceive him
5. **Unclear Current Solutions:** Don't know his actual journey or what he's tried that failed
6. **Low Confidence:** Many "likely," "appears to," "possibly" qualifiers indicating uncertainty

**Major Research Gaps:**
1. **Need 5-7 direct interviews** exploring:
   - What actually motivates commercialization interest?
   - What are the real frustrations (vs. inferred from questions)?
   - What does the day-to-day experience feel like?
   - What has he tried that didn't work and why?
   - What would ideal support look like?

2. **Need colleague/student interviews** to understand:
   - How others perceive his approach
   - What his reputation is in the department
   - How he's viewed by potential partners

3. **Need to validate behavioral patterns:**
   - Why the evening/weekend work pattern?
   - Why the burst engagement with validation tasks?
   - What drives the question patterns observed?

**Path to Improvement:**
- Conduct 5-7 in-depth interviews with Carlos: Could reach Score 4
- Add 3-4 colleague/partner interviews: Could support Score 5
- Validate hypotheses and replace inferred content with direct quotes
- Document current solution journey with specific tools and gaps

**When to Use This Persona:**

✅ **Good For:**
- Designing interview questions for validation research
- Identifying hypothesis to test
- Planning research strategy
- Understanding what behavioral data suggests

❌ **NOT Good For:**
- Vianeo submission (too weak for competitive scoring)
- Making product decisions (too many unvalidated assumptions)
- Representing real user needs (need actual user voice)

**Usage Notes:**
- This persona represents what we *think* we know, not what we *actually* know
- Use as research planning tool, not as validated stakeholder insight
- All ⚠️ markers indicate unvalidated content requiring research
- Do NOT present this as a validated persona - clearly mark as hypothesis-generating
