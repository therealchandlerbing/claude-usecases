**Type:** Partner
**Validation Status:** ⭐ Validated - Strong Quality (Score 4)
**Sources:** 8 interviews with university tech transfer office staff
**Geographic Context:** Brazilian university system

### Layer 1: Requester (Who They Are)

**Name:** Maria
**Age:** 42

**Life / Motivations:**
Maria serves as Deputy Director of a university technology transfer office, managing partnerships between academic researchers and industry partners across Latin America. She's driven by a desire to see Brazilian innovations make real-world impact rather than staying confined to academic papers. Having witnessed talented researchers struggle to commercialize their discoveries, she's passionate about building bridges between academia and industry that actually work.

**Personality / Values:**
Maria is pragmatic and relationship-oriented, preferring to build trust through consistent follow-through rather than flashy promises. She values transparency in partnership agreements and becomes frustrated when processes lack clarity or when bureaucracy slows down momentum. She approaches decisions methodically, needing to see evidence and precedent before committing, but once convinced, she becomes a dedicated advocate.

**Evidence Notes:**
- "I want to see our innovations help people, not just generate papers" (Interview 3)
- Mentioned relationship-building approach in 7 of 8 interviews
- Methodical decision-making pattern observed across all sources

### Layer 2: Field of Application (Their World)

**Thinks / Feels:**
Maria worries that valuable university innovations are being lost because the validation process is too slow and complex for most researchers to navigate. She feels caught between university bureaucracy demanding complete documentation and researchers wanting simple, fast support. She hopes that streamlined validation approaches will allow more innovations to reach the market, but fears that shortcuts might expose the university to legal or reputational risks.

**Observes:**
Maria sees researchers with promising technologies give up when faced with complex partnership paperwork and multi-month approval timelines. She notices that successful partnerships always have a clear point person on both sides, while projects without dedicated champions tend to stall regardless of technical merit. She's observed that language barriers (Portuguese/English) create more friction than most people acknowledge, leading to misaligned expectations.

**Does:**
Maria spends her days reviewing partnership proposals, mediating between university legal teams and external partners, and coaching researchers through partnership processes. She maintains detailed tracking spreadsheets to monitor project timelines and prevent things from falling through cracks. She regularly translates documents and explains processes in both Portuguese and English, serving as cultural translator as much as administrative coordinator.

**Others Say:**
Colleagues describe Maria as "the person who actually gets things done" and "incredibly organized but not rigid." Researchers say she "explains complicated processes in ways that make sense" and appreciate that "she follows up without being asked." Partners note that "working with Maria means no surprises - she tells you exactly what to expect and delivers on it."

**Evidence Notes:**
- "I see researchers quit when timelines stretch past 6 months" (Interview 5)
- All 8 interviews mentioned spreadsheet tracking system
- Language barrier issue raised in 6 of 8 interviews
- Quotes about reputation from 3rd-party feedback collected

### Layer 3: Activities and Challenges (What They Do and Struggle With)

**Tasks / Activities:**
- Review and process 15-20 partnership proposals monthly, assessing fit with university priorities and legal requirements
- Coordinate between university legal department, researchers, and external partners to align on contract terms
- Maintain tracking systems for all active partnerships (currently monitoring 47 projects at various stages)
- Translate and localize partnership materials between Portuguese and English
- Coach researchers on partnership requirements and help them prepare required documentation
- Report to university leadership on partnership portfolio status and impact metrics

**Pains / Lacks:**
- Spends 10-12 hours weekly on manual status updates and progress chasing because systems don't talk to each other
- Lacks standardized templates for common partnership types, requiring custom contract negotiation each time
- University legal review takes 6-8 weeks on average, causing partner frustration and momentum loss
- No clear criteria for which innovations should be prioritized, leading to difficult conversations with researchers
- Limited visibility into what happens after partnerships are signed - hard to demonstrate impact or learn from outcomes
- Struggles to find precedents for novel partnership structures, slowing down innovative arrangements

**Expectations / Hopes:**
- Reduce partnership approval timeline from 6-8 weeks to 2-3 weeks for standard cases
- Have clear qualification criteria that help researchers self-assess partnership readiness
- Access templates and precedents for common partnership structures across Latin American universities
- Gain visibility into partnership outcomes to demonstrate value and improve processes
- Enable researchers to track their own project status without constant email check-ins
- Build a network of peer institutions sharing best practices and solving common challenges together

**Evidence Notes:**
- 10-12 hour figure from time tracking data shared by 3 interviewees
- 6-8 week legal review timeline confirmed in 7 of 8 interviews
- All interviews mentioned lack of templates as major pain point
- Hope for 2-3 week timeline mentioned by 5 interviewees as "ideal state"

### Layer 4: Current Solutions (Their Present Reality)

**Current Solutions:**
Maria currently uses a combination of Excel spreadsheets for project tracking, email folders for document management, and DocuSign for contract execution. While these tools work for individual functions, they don't integrate, requiring her to manually synchronize information across systems and chase people for updates. The university recently implemented a research administration system (SigProj), but it's designed for grant management rather than partnership coordination, so it doesn't capture the specific workflows she needs for industry relationships.

**Evidence Notes:**
- Excel + email + DocuSign combination mentioned in all 8 interviews
- SigProj limitation noted by 6 of 8 respondents
- "Tools work but don't talk to each other" (Interview 2)
- Manual synchronization quantified as 10-12 hours/week

**Key Quotes:**

> "I spend half my week just updating spreadsheets and sending 'what's the status' emails. The information exists, it's just scattered across five different places."
> - Interview 2

> "Researchers get excited about partnerships, then legal says it'll take 8 weeks, and I watch that excitement drain away. Sometimes they just give up."
> - Interview 5

> "I want clear criteria I can point to. Right now I have to tell researchers 'I'll check with leadership' for every project. There must be patterns we could codify."
> - Interview 3

> "DocuSign is great for signatures, Excel is great for tracking, email works for communication. But making them work together? That's my full-time job right there."
> - Interview 6

> "The Portuguese-English thing is bigger than people think. It's not just translation - it's different expectations about timelines, formality, everything."
> - Interview 7

**Pattern Frequency:**
