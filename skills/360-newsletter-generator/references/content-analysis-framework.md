### Example Scoring

**Partnership signature:**
```
Base score: 95 (partnership announcement)
+ 10 (international partner)
+ 15 (revenue impact)
+ 10 (advances strategic priorities)
= 130 → capped at 100
Final: 100 (Critical)
```

**Project completion:**
```
Base score: 85 (project completion with impact)
+ 10 (impact component)
+ 10 (first of its kind methodology)
= 105 → capped at 100
Final: 100 (Critical)
```

**Pipeline progress:**
```
Base score: 70 (pipeline progress)
+ 10 (international)
+ 0 (no other modifiers)
= 80
Final: 80 (Medium)
```

**Routine task:**
```
Base score: 40 (routine completion)
- 20 (administrative)
- 10 (internal-only)
= 10
Final: 10 (Minimal)
```

## Lead Story Selection

### Selection Criteria

Choose lead story based on:

1. **Highest significance score** (95-100 range strongly preferred)
2. **Strategic importance to 360's mission**
3. **Stakeholder relevance** (board, partners, clients)
4. **Impact magnitude** (systems change, market expansion)
5. **Timeliness** (announcement vs. ongoing work)

### Decision Tree

```
Does any item score 95-100?
├─ YES: Is it truly transformational?
│  ├─ YES: Lead story candidate
│  └─ NO: Check next highest scorer
└─ NO: What's the highest score?
   ├─ 85-94: Consider as lead if strategically critical
   ├─ 70-84: Use as supporting story, not lead
   └─ <70: Not lead-worthy
```

### Multiple High Scorers

If multiple items score 95-100:

**Option 1: Choose most transformational**
- Which has broadest organizational impact?
- Which advances mission most significantly?
- Which stakeholders care most about?

**Option 2: Combine related items into composite lead**
Example: "Team restructuring accelerates as Space Studios merger enters 90-day transition"
- Combines: Team changes + Partnership milestone
- Unified narrative
- Greater strategic context

**Option 3: Feature all as "co-leads"**
- Rare, use only for truly equal priority
- Structure as multiple sub-sections in lead story area
- Each gets substantial treatment

### Edge Cases

**No items score above 85:**
- Create composite lead from 2-3 strongest items
- Frame as "Momentum across multiple fronts"
- Still use lead story format but acknowledge distributed progress

**Sparse data period (holiday, vacation):**
- Be transparent: "Light activity during [period]"
- Focus on strategic planning or relationship maintenance
- Forward-looking: What's coming up

**Only operational/routine updates:**
- Frame as operational excellence
- Highlight efficiency or capacity building
- Connect to strategic preparation

## Section Assignment

### Section Mapping Rules

| Content Type | Primary Section | Alternative Section |
|--------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Partnership agreements, pipeline | Partnerships & Ecosystem | - |
| Partnership communications | Partnerships & Ecosystem | Programs (if project-specific) |
| Technology assessments, client work | Programs & Innovation | Partnerships (if partnership-focused) |
| Impact metrics, testimonials | Impact & Outcomes | Programs (if program-specific) |
| Team updates, hiring | Operations & Capacity | - |
| Financial metrics | Operations & Capacity | Strategic Horizon (if future-focused) |
| Infrastructure improvements | Operations & Capacity | - |
| Board decisions | Strategic Horizon | Operations (if operational) |
| Upcoming events, deadlines | Strategic Horizon | - |

### Multi-Category Items

Some items fit multiple sections. Choose based on **primary emphasis**:

**Partnership + Impact:**
```
Example: Partnership that delivered community outcomes
Primary emphasis: The partnership itself
→ Partnerships section, mention impact within story
```

**Program + Operations:**
```
Example: New methodology that required team training
Primary emphasis: The methodology/program
→ Programs section, mention operations within story
```

**Operations + Strategy:**
```
Example: Team hire that enables strategic expansion
Primary emphasis: Strategic implication
→ Strategic Horizon, mention hire within story
```

### Section Balance

Aim for balance across sections:

**Minimum per section:**
- 2 substantive stories
- OR 1 story + 1 chart
- OR Executive summary mention if truly sparse

**Maximum per section:**
- 6 stories (more becomes overwhelming)
- Split into subsections if needed

**If section is empty:**
- Note in section header: "No significant updates this period"
- Or omit section entirely (for custom briefs)
- Or include forward-looking items: "Upcoming in..."

## Content Prioritization Within Sections

### Story Order Within Section

**Priority 1: Highest significance score**
- Most important story first
- Sets tone for section

**Priority 2: Strategic relevance**
- Even if lower score, strategic stories go high
- Especially for board briefs

**Priority 3: Stakeholder interest**
- What will readers care most about?
- What drives decisions?

**Priority 4: Timeliness**
- Recent developments before older ones
- Urgent before routine

### Story Length Allocation

**High significance (85-100):**
- Full card with context paragraph
- 3-5 bullet points
- Chart if data available
- Action items if relevant

**Medium significance (70-84):**
- Standard card with brief context
- 2-3 bullet points
- Mention in text, less visual prominence

**Low significance (40-69):**
- Brief mention only
- Bullet point in list
- Or omit from newsletter entirely

## Action Item Identification

### When to Flag as Action Item

Flag if ALL of these are true:
1. Requires decision or action
2. Has clear responsible party
3. Has deadline (or needs one)
4. Affects strategic priorities

### Action Item Priority Levels

**Critical (red):**
- Deadline within 3 days
- High strategic impact
- Blocks other work
- Board/leadership decision needed

**Action Required (yellow):**
- Deadline within 1-2 weeks
- Moderate strategic impact
- Affects key stakeholders
- Requires coordination

**Monitoring (gray):**
- Deadline >2 weeks or flexible
- Lower strategic impact
- Watching for changes
- May need action later

### Action Item Structure

```html
<div class="action-item">
  <div class="action-title">
    [SPECIFIC, ACTIONABLE TITLE]
  </div>
  <div class="action-detail">
    [CONTEXT: Why this matters, what's at stake]
  </div>
  <div class="action-meta">
    <span><i class="fas fa-user"></i> [RESPONSIBLE PERSON/TEAM]</span>
    <span><i class="fas fa-calendar"></i> Due [SPECIFIC DATE]</span>
    <span><i class="fas fa-[icon]"></i> [STATUS]</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Quality Assurance for Scoring

### Calibration Checks

**After initial scoring, verify:**

1. **Does the lead story feel right?**
   - If you had to explain the period to the board, would you lead with this?
   - Does it capture the most important development?

2. **Are high scores justified?**
   - Would a board member agree this is "critical"?
   - Does the evidence support the significance claim?

3. **Are sections balanced?**
   - Any section dramatically heavier than others?
   - Does the distribution reflect actual organizational focus?

4. **Are action items truly action items?**
   - Do they require decisions/actions, or just awareness?
   - Are responsible parties and deadlines accurate?

### Common Scoring Errors

**Overscoring:**
- Routine task scored as strategic milestone
- Internal process improvement scored as transformational
- Personal bias inflating score

**Underscoring:**
- Major partnership treated as routine update
- Significant impact downplayed
- Strategic relevance overlooked

**Misassignment:**
- Partnership update placed in operations
- Impact story buried in programs
- Strategic item relegated to routine section

### Correction Process

If scoring seems off:

1. **Review the evidence**
   - What actually happened?
   - What was the impact?
   - Who cares about this?

2. **Apply scoring criteria objectively**
   - Use the matrix systematically
   - Apply modifiers consistently
   - Check against examples

3. **Seek second opinion**
   - Would user agree with this assessment?
   - Would board member score similarly?
   - Does it pass "common sense" test?

## Strategic Context Integration

### Connecting to 360's Mission

Every high-significance story should connect to:
- Partnership development and ecosystem building
- Innovation portfolio assessment and validation
- International business development
- Social impact measurement and systems change
- Technology commercialization and transfer

### Stakeholder Relevance

Consider these stakeholders when scoring:
- **Board**: Governance, strategy, sustainability
- **Partners**: Collaboration opportunities, ecosystem
- **Clients**: Service delivery, impact
- **Funders**: Mission alignment, outcomes
- **Team**: Capacity, resources, direction

### Time Horizon

Score higher if:
- Immediate impact (this week/month)
- Long-term strategic benefit (1-3 years)

Score lower if:
- Distant future only (>3 years)
- Speculative or uncertain
