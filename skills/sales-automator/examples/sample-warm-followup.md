# Sample Warm Follow-Up Campaign

**Scenario**: Following up with GlobalTech Solutions after 3-month gap in conversation

**Target**: Marcus Johnson, Director of Partnerships at GlobalTech Solutions

**Background**: Had initial discovery call in August. They were interested but timing wasn't right due to Q3 budget freeze.

---

## Intelligence Gathered

### Relationship History
- **Last Contact**: August 15 (3 months ago)
- **Previous Interaction**: 45-minute discovery call
- **Their Situation**: Budget frozen through Q3, asked to reconnect in Q4
- **Pain Points Discussed**: Manual partnership tracking, no centralized deal pipeline
- **Objections**: Wanted to see proof of ROI, concerned about implementation time

### Recent Developments
- **Web Search**: GlobalTech just announced Q4 earnings beat (30% revenue growth)
- **Calendar**: No meetings scheduled since August call
- **Gmail**: Last email from Marcus: "Let's revisit this in October when budgets reopen"
- **Asana**: Deal task exists, stage: Discovery, marked "Cold"

### New Positioning Angles
- Q4 budgets should now be available
- New case study since August: Partnership team scaled from 5 to 20 deals/month
- Reduced implementation time: Now 2 weeks vs. 4 weeks (addressing their objection)

## Email Sequence (3 Touches, 14 Days)

### Email 1: Reference Past + New Value
**Subject**: Following up on our August partnership discussion

**Send**: Day 0

```
Hi Marcus,

It's been 3 months since we talked about partnership tracking and pipeline management for GlobalTech.

You mentioned budget would reopen in Q4 and timing would be better to revisit. I also saw GlobalTech crushed Q4 earnings - congrats on the 30% growth!

I wanted to reach out because we've made some meaningful improvements since August that directly address the concerns you raised:

**What's new since we last talked**:
- Implementation time reduced from 4 weeks to 2 weeks (you mentioned speed was important)
- New case study: Partnership team at MediaCorp scaled from 5 to 20 active deals/month using our system
- ROI calculator that shows payback in 60 days based on deal velocity improvement

**Why it matters for GlobalTech**: With your growth trajectory, you mentioned your partnerships team is underwater managing deal flow manually. These improvements make it faster and lower-risk to test if our approach works for you.

Would it make sense to reconnect for 20 minutes to see if the timing's better now?

I'm available [Day 1] or [Day 2] next week.

Best,
Chandler

P.S. - How did that Q3 partnership with Acme Corp end up going? You mentioned it was a big one.
```

**A/B Test Subjects**:
- Option A: "Following up on our August partnership discussion"
- Option B: "Q4 timing for GlobalTech partnership tracking"
- Recommended: Option A (references past conversation specifically)

### Email 2: Specific Proposal
**Subject**: Partnership proposal for GlobalTech

**Send**: Day 5 (if positive response or no response to Email 1)

```
Hi Marcus,

Based on our August conversation, I've put together a specific proposal for how we could help GlobalTech scale your partnerships operations.

**Scope**:
- Partnership pipeline tracking in Asana (30+ deals)
- Automated follow-up sequences for warm partners
- Deal health monitoring and stuck deal alerts
- Weekly pipeline reports and forecasting

**Timeline**: 2-week implementation + ongoing optimization
**Investment**: $50K annual subscription
**Expected Outcome**: 3x increase in active deals managed, 40% improvement in deal velocity

I've attached the full proposal with:
- Detailed approach based on your team's workflow
- MediaCorp case study (similar team size, 4x deal throughput)
- ROI calculation (60-day payback based on your numbers)
- Implementation plan with milestones

Would Tuesday or Thursday work for a 30-minute call to walk through it and answer questions?

Best,
Chandler

### Email 3: Clear CTA with Timeline
**Subject**: Decision timeline on partnership automation

**Send**: Day 10 (if no response to Email 2)

```
Hi Marcus,

Just checking in on the proposal I sent last week.

To give you context on timing: We're locking in our Q1 client calendar by December 15, so if GlobalTech is interested in moving forward for a January start, we'd need to align by then.

If this isn't the right time, totally understand. We can always revisit in Q1 or Q2.

What makes sense on your end?

Best,
Chandler

## Success Metrics

**Primary Goal**: Advance deal from Discovery to Proposal stage, book proposal review meeting

**Secondary Goals**:
- Response to Email 1: >30% (warm leads should respond higher than cold)
- Meeting booked: >20%
- Proposal review scheduled

**Conversion Probability**: 25% (warm follow-up baseline)

---

## Optimization Notes

- **Why this works**:
  - Respects their timeline (they asked for Q4 follow-up)
  - References specific pain points from August call
  - Addresses their objections proactively (speed, ROI)
  - Includes new developments that strengthen case

- **Risk**: Marcus may have moved on to another solution during 3-month gap

- **Mitigation**: If no response by Day 10, LinkedIn research to confirm he's still at GlobalTech and in same role

- **Follow-up**: If proposal accepted, fast-track to contract (they've already been through discovery)

- Shorter sequence (3 touches vs. 5)
- Faster cadence (14 days vs. 21 days)
