## Email Sequence (5 Touches, 21 Days)

### Email 1: Insight-Led Introduction
**Subject**: What TechVenture's Series B competitors are doing differently

**Send**: Day 0

```
Hi Sarah,

Congrats on the Series B! I've been tracking companies in the customer success space that raised similar rounds, and there's an interesting pattern in how they're scaling their GTM teams.

The surprising part? The highest performers aren't automating more outreach. They're automating research and personalization, so every email their team sends is grounded in actual context about the prospect.

We recently worked with CloudSync (similar stage to TechVenture) when they were scaling from $8M to $40M ARR. Their challenge was maintaining quality outreach while 5x-ing their sales team.

Result: They improved response rates from 4% to 12% while cutting sales cycle time by 40%.

Not sure if this applies to TechVenture's growth plans, but given you just brought on 50 new hires, I figured it was worth sharing.

Curious about the details? I can send over the case study.

P.S. - How are you thinking about sales enablement for your new team?

**A/B Test Subjects**:
- Option A: "What TechVenture's Series B competitors are doing differently"
- Option B: "12% response rates for B2B SaaS (case study)"
- Recommended: Option A (more personalized, creates curiosity)

### Email 2: Case Study + Soft Ask
**Subject**: CloudSync case study (for context)

**Send**: Day 3 (if no response to Email 1)

```
Hi Sarah,

Following up on my last email. I mentioned our work with CloudSync and figured I'd share the actual case study in case it's helpful context.

**The Challenge**: Scaling from 10 to 50 sales reps while maintaining outreach quality and forecast accuracy

**Our Approach**: Implemented relationship intelligence system that auto-researches prospects across email history, meetings, and public data before generating personalized outreach

**The Result**:
- Response rates: 4% → 12%
- Meeting booking rate: 5% → 18%
- Sales cycle time: -40%
- Pipeline forecast accuracy: +45%

The reason I'm sharing this: CloudSync was at a similar inflection point to where TechVenture is now with the Series B and new team buildout.

If you're dealing with similar growth challenges, I'd be happy to share what we've learned about scaling sales operations without sacrificing personalization.

Worth a quick 15-minute conversation?

Best,
Chandler

### Email 3: Direct Ask with Urgency
**Subject**: Partnership timeline for TechVenture

**Send**: Day 7 (if no response to Emails 1-2)

```
Hi Sarah,

Quick question: Is scaling your sales team's outreach quality a priority for TechVenture in Q1?

I ask because we're finalizing our client calendar through March, and we typically work with only 3-4 hyper-growth SaaS companies at a time to ensure we can deliver results like CloudSync's.

We currently have 2 spots open for January starts.

If the timing's right, let's grab 15 minutes to explore if there's a fit. If not, no worries at all.

Here's my calendar: [calendly.com/chandlerlewis]

Best,
Chandler

P.S. - If I'm off base here and this isn't a priority, just let me know. I'll stop filling your inbox.
```

### Email 4: Breakup Email
**Subject**: Should I stop emailing you?

**Send**: Day 14 (if no response to Emails 1-3)

```
Hi Sarah,

I've reached out a few times about sales enablement for your new team but haven't heard back.

I'll take that as a sign this isn't a priority right now, which is completely understandable.

Before I remove you from my list, I wanted to check one last time: Should I stop emailing you about this, or is it just bad timing?

If it's bad timing, when would be a better time to circle back?

If it's not a fit, no hard feelings. Just reply "not interested" and I'll close the loop.

Best,
Chandler

### Email 5: Alternative Angle / Resource Share
**Subject**: Sales enablement playbook for hyper-growth teams (no strings attached)

**Send**: Day 21 (if no response to Email 4)

```
Hi Sarah,

This is my last email (I promise).

I know you're busy with the Series B execution, and sales automation might not be on your radar right now.

That said, I put together a resource on scaling sales teams from 10 to 100+ reps that I think you'd find valuable regardless of whether we ever work together:

[Link to: Hyper-Growth Sales Playbook]

No ask, no pitch. Just thought it might be helpful given TechVenture's growth trajectory.

If circumstances change and you want to revisit the conversation, you know where to find me.

Best,
Chandler

P.S. - Really impressive what you're building at TechVenture. Excited to see where you take it.
