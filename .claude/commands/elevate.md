# Elevate to Professional Quality

Apply professional design polish to the current work using the **Design Director** skill.

## Instructions

Invoke the `design-director` skill to transform functional output into professionally polished, design-elevated work.

## Design Elevation Process

1. **Assess Current State**
   - Review existing output (dashboard, presentation, HTML, document)
   - Identify design improvement opportunities
   - Match audience sophistication level

2. **Apply Design Principles**
   - Typography: Inter/SF Pro/system fonts at proper scale (15px/24px)
   - Color: Reference Stripe (#0A2540), Linear (#5E6AD2), or brand-specific
   - Layout: Proper white space, visual hierarchy, grid alignment
   - Accessibility: WCAG AA compliance, proper contrast ratios

3. **Reference Excellence**
   - Stripe for dashboard clarity and financial UI
   - Linear for information hierarchy
   - Apple for restraint and typography
   - Swiss design for systematic thinking

## Output Standards

Every elevated output should:
- Look hand-crafted, not template-based
- Use deliberate white space (not default padding)
- Have clear typography relationships
- Feature considered color relationships
- Display proper visual hierarchy

## Usage

Apply this command after generating any visual output that needs polish:
- HTML dashboards
- Presentations
- Reports
- Data visualizations
- Client-facing materials
