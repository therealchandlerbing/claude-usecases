# Usage Tips

1. **Single skills vs workflows**: Use single commands for focused tasks, workflows for complex multi-step processes
2. **Both methods work**: Use `/brief` or say "Generate my morning executive brief"
3. **Customize depth**: Most workflows have Quick/Standard/Comprehensive modes
4. **Design polish**: Run `/elevate` after generating any visual output
5. **Manual orchestration**: Use `/orchestrate` for custom multi-skill sequences
