# Build Stakeholder Persona

Generate evidence-backed personas using the **Strategic Persona Builder** skill.

## Instructions

Invoke the `strategic-persona-builder` skill to synthesize research data into actionable stakeholder personas.

## Required Input

Provide one or more of:
- Interview transcripts
- Survey responses
- Behavioral observation notes
- Existing stakeholder documentation
- Research data and notes

## Supported Frameworks

**Vianeo Four-Layer Framework** (Primary)
- Layer 1: Requester (demographics, motivations, values)
- Layer 2: Field of Application (observes, thinks, feels, does)
- Layer 3: Activities & Challenges (tasks, pains, expectations)
- Layer 4: Current Solutions (workarounds, gaps)

**Jobs-to-be-Done Framework**
- Functional jobs (tasks to accomplish)
- Emotional jobs (feelings to achieve)
- Social jobs (how they want to be perceived)

**Empathy Mapping**
- Says, thinks, does, feels quadrants

## Output Format

For each persona:
- **Strategic Version** - Comprehensive documentation for internal use
- **Platform Version** - Formatted for Vianeo platform entry (character limits applied)
- **Evidence Index** - Citations to source data
- **Validation Status** - Confidence levels and research gaps
- **Distinctiveness Score** - How differentiated from other personas

## Quality Principles

- Every claim traceable to source data
- Assumptions clearly marked
- Gaps flagged for additional research
- Practical over academic
- Distinctive personas, not overlapping
