# Vianeo Four-Layer Framework

Deep-dive documentation on the Vianeo framework structure for technology validation personas.

---

## Overview

The Vianeo four-layer framework structures stakeholder understanding into progressive depth: who they are, their world, their challenges, and their current reality. This systematic approach ensures completeness and reveals gaps in research data.

---

## Layer 1: Requester (Who They Are)

**Purpose:** Establish the human behind the need through context, drivers, and values.

### Components

**First Name**
- Specific, memorable name (Sarah, not "User")
- Should feel like a real person
- Avoid generic or placeholder names

**Age**
- Exact number, not range (34, not "30s")
- Enables specific life-stage understanding
- Affects communication and technology preferences

**Life/Motivations**
- 2-3 sentences
- Daily context and role
- Why they care about this domain
- What drives their professional decisions

**Personality/Values**
- 2-3 sentences
- Character traits affecting decisions
- Communication style preferences
- Risk tolerance and change orientation

### Quality Indicators
- Specific enough to feel like real individual
- Details traceable to interview data
- Motivations explain subsequent behaviors
- Values predict decision patterns

---

## Layer 2: Field of Application (Their World)

**Purpose:** Capture mental models, observations, behaviors, and social context.

### Components

**Thinks/Feels**
- 2-3 sentences
- Internal thoughts and concerns
- Worries they might not voice
- Hopes and aspirations in domain

**Observes**
- 2-3 sentences
- What they witness in environment
- Patterns they notice
- Industry trends affecting them

**Does**
- 2-3 sentences
- Actual behaviors and habits
- Actions (not intentions)
- How they spend time

**Others Say**
- 2-3 sentences
- Feedback they receive
- Reputation and perception
- External perspectives on them

### Quality Indicators
- Behaviors are observable actions
- Thoughts supported by interview quotes
- Others Say reflects actual feedback
- Creates coherent picture of their world

---

## Layer 3: Activities and Challenges (What They Do and Struggle With)

**Purpose:** Document tasks, pain points, and concrete hopes.

### Components

**Tasks/Activities**
- 4-6 bullets
- Specific responsibilities
- Recurring processes
- Time-consuming activities
- Observable actions they perform

**Pains/Lacks**
- 4-6 bullets
- Frustrations with current state
- Gaps in capability or resources
- Inefficiencies they experience
- Problems they can't solve

**Expectations/Hopes**
- 4-6 bullets
- Desired outcomes (not solutions)
- Improvements they want
- What success looks like
- Outcomes-focused, not product-focused

### Quality Indicators
- Tasks are specific, not generic
- Pains quantified when possible (hours, dollars, frequency)
- Expectations outcome-based (not "want X product")
- All items traceable to evidence

---

## Layer 4: Current Solutions (Their Present Reality)

**Purpose:** Show understanding of current workarounds, why they fail, and gaps.

### Components

**Current Solutions**
- 2-3 sentences
- What they use now (specific products/services)
- Why current solutions are inadequate
- Specific gaps and workarounds
- What they've tried and abandoned

### Quality Indicators
- Specific products/services named
- Clear gap analysis (not just "doesn't work")
- Explains why they're open to alternatives
- Shows research into their reality

---

## Platform Constraints (Vianeo Entry)

### Character Limits
- **Need statements:** <60 characters
- **Text fields:** 2-3 sentences (not paragraphs)
- **Bullet lists:** 4-6 items

### Format Requirements
- Clean, copy-paste ready
- Character counts displayed
- Validation badges included
- No markdown formatting in entry fields

---

## Scoring Alignment

### Score 5: Exceptional Personas
**Layer 1:** Specific individual with clear motivation evidence
**Layer 2:** Rich behavioral data with direct quotes
**Layer 3:** Quantified pains, specific tasks, outcome-focused hopes
**Layer 4:** Named solutions with detailed gap analysis

### Score 4: Strong Personas
**Layer 1:** Clear individual profile with supporting evidence
**Layer 2:** Good behavioral detail
**Layer 3:** Specific pains and tasks, mostly measurable
**Layer 4:** Current solutions identified with basic gaps

### Score 3: Adequate Personas
**Layer 1:** Basic demographics with some context
**Layer 2:** Limited behavioral information
**Layer 3:** Tasks and pains identified but not specific
**Layer 4:** Solutions mentioned but not analyzed

### Score 2-1: Weak/Hypothesis
**Layer 1:** Generic or assumed demographics
**Layer 2:** Little to no behavioral data
**Layer 3:** Generic or assumed needs
**Layer 4:** Vague or missing solution analysis

---

## Common Mistakes

### Layer 1 Mistakes
- Using age ranges instead of specific ages
- Generic names ("User", "Professional")
- Motivations that don't connect to behaviors

### Layer 2 Mistakes
- Mixing behaviors with intentions
- Others Say without actual sources
- Thinks/Feels without interview support

### Layer 3 Mistakes
- Solution-first hopes ("wants our product")
- Vague pain points ("frustrated")
- Tasks that are too generic

### Layer 4 Mistakes
- Missing entirely
- Vague ("uses existing tools")
- No gap analysis
- Not explaining why they're open to change

---

## Evidence Requirements

| Element | Minimum Evidence |
|---------|-----------------|
| First Name/Age | Representative of segment |
| Life/Motivations | 2+ interview references |
| Personality/Values | 3+ behavioral observations |
| Thinks/Feels | Direct quotes preferred |
| Observes/Does | Observable actions documented |
| Others Say | Actual feedback sources |
| Tasks | Interview-confirmed activities |
| Pains | Specific complaints from data |
| Hopes | Expressed desires, not assumed |
| Current Solutions | Named products with gap reasons |

## Example: Complete Four-Layer Structure

### Layer 1: Requester
**Name:** Sarah
**Age:** 42
**Life/Motivations:** Director of Research Partnerships at a mid-size university, Sarah manages 15+ industry collaboration agreements. She's driven by the potential for research to create real-world impact and is frustrated when promising technologies fail to reach market due to validation gaps.
**Personality/Values:** Sarah is methodical and evidence-driven, preferring structured processes over ad-hoc approaches. She values transparency in partner relationships and will slow down to ensure proper documentation rather than rush through decisions.

### Layer 2: Field of Application
**Thinks/Feels:** Worries that without systematic validation, research investments will continue to produce papers but not products. Feels caught between academic timelines and industry urgency.
**Observes:** Sees technology transfer success rates stagnating despite increased funding. Notes that partners who use structured validation achieve faster commercialization.
**Does:** Reviews partnership proposals weekly, tracks milestone completion across all projects, conducts quarterly partner satisfaction assessments.
**Others Say:** Partners describe her as "thorough but sometimes slow." Her team values her protection from scope creep but wants faster decision cycles.

### Layer 3: Activities and Challenges
**Tasks:**
- Evaluate partnership proposals for strategic fit (3-4/week)
- Monitor active project milestones (15+ projects)
- Facilitate partner communication and conflict resolution
- Report validation metrics to leadership quarterly

**Pains:**
- 40% of validation time spent recreating data partners already collected
- No standardized framework causes inconsistent evaluation across projects
- Partners unclear on validation requirements until late stages
- Manual tracking across spreadsheets prone to errors

**Expectations:**
- Reduce redundant data collection by 50%
- Standardize validation framework across all partnerships
- Give partners clarity on requirements from project start
- Automate progress tracking with real-time dashboards

### Layer 4: Current Solutions
Currently uses a combination of custom Excel trackers (one per project), email chains for partner communication, and annual surveys for satisfaction data. The fragmentation means she can't quickly assess portfolio health or compare validation approaches across projects. Previous attempt to standardize using SharePoint was abandoned after 6 months due to poor partner adoption.
