## Combining Frameworks

### Vianeo + JTBD
**Use case:** Technology validation with innovation focus

**Approach:**
- Use Vianeo four-layer structure as primary
- Add JTBD job statements to Layer 3 (Activities)
- Include pain/gain prioritization in analysis

**Output:** Full Vianeo personas with job statement appendix

### Vianeo + Empathy Mapping
**Use case:** Validation project with team alignment need

**Approach:**
- Build complete Vianeo personas
- Create empathy map summary for each persona
- Use empathy maps for team workshops

**Output:** Vianeo personas + empathy map quick reference

### JTBD + Empathy Mapping
**Use case:** Product development with team collaboration

**Approach:**
- Start with empathy maps during research
- Synthesize into JTBD job statements
- Use empathy maps to maintain human context

**Output:** Job statements with empathy map context

### Custom Hybrid
**Use case:** Unique requirements

**Approach:**
1. Identify required elements from each framework
2. Design structure that covers all needs
3. Ensure evidence requirements are clear
4. Define quality criteria for hybrid

---

## Evidence Requirements by Framework

### Vianeo
- Direct interview quotes (Layer 2 especially)
- Behavioral observations (Layer 2, 3)
- Current solution documentation (Layer 4)
- Validation markers throughout

### JTBD
- Behavioral evidence for jobs
- Pain point frequency/severity data
- Outcome success criteria
- Alternative solutions tried

### Empathy Mapping
- Direct quotes (Says quadrant)
- Observable behaviors (Does quadrant)
- Emotional indicators (Feels quadrant)
- Inferred thoughts with support

---

## Scoring Considerations

### Vianeo
Full 1-5 rubric with specific criteria per score level. Designed for competitive assessment.

### JTBD
Typically scored by:
- Job importance (1-10)
- Current satisfaction (1-10)
- Opportunity score = Importance + (Importance - Satisfaction)

### Empathy Mapping
Usually not scored numerically. Quality assessed by:
- Presence of direct quotes
- Observable vs. assumed behaviors
- Coherence across quadrants

---

## Common Mistakes by Framework

### Vianeo Mistakes
- Skipping Layer 4 (current solutions)
- Generic Layer 1 (not specific individual)
- Solution-first hopes in Layer 3

### JTBD Mistakes
- Confusing jobs with tasks
- Missing emotional/social jobs
- Solution-focused gain statements

### Empathy Mapping Mistakes
- All quadrants from assumption
- Says without actual quotes
- Does without observed behaviors
- Feels without evidence
