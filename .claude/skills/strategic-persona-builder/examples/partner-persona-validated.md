## Partner Persona: Sarah

### Layer 1: Requester (Who They Are)

**Name:** Sarah
**Age:** 42

**Life/Motivations:**
Director of Research Partnerships at a mid-size university, Sarah manages 15+ industry collaboration agreements annually. She's driven by the potential for research to create real-world impact and is frustrated when promising technologies fail to reach market due to validation gaps. Her success is measured by both partnership revenue and commercialization outcomes, creating tension between volume and quality. [7/8 interviews mentioned impact motivation]

**Personality/Values:**
Sarah is methodical and evidence-driven, preferring structured processes over ad-hoc approaches. She values transparency in partner relationships and will slow down to ensure proper documentation rather than rush through decisions. She's risk-aware but not risk-averse—willing to pursue ambitious partnerships with appropriate safeguards. [5/8 interviews confirmed process-oriented approach]

---

### Layer 2: Field of Application (Their World)

**Thinks/Feels:**
Worries that without systematic validation, research investments will continue to produce papers but not products. Feels caught between academic timelines (years) and industry urgency (months). Privately concerned that her university's validation approach is falling behind peer institutions but struggles to find time to research alternatives. [Direct quote: "I know we're not best-in-class on this, but I can't stop to fix the plane while flying it."]

**Observes:**
Sees technology transfer success rates stagnating despite increased funding (8% commercialization rate over past 5 years). Notes that partners who use structured validation achieve faster time-to-market (18 months vs. 30 months average). Watches competitors announce partnerships with companies her university approached. [6/8 interviews cited competitive pressure]

**Does:**
Reviews partnership proposals weekly (3-4 per week). Tracks milestone completion across all active projects using spreadsheets. Conducts quarterly partner satisfaction assessments. Holds bi-weekly check-ins with highest-priority partners. Spends 40% of time on administrative tasks she wishes she could automate. [Observable from 8/8 interviews]

**Others Say:**
Partners describe her as "thorough but sometimes slow." Her team values her protection from scope creep but wants faster decision cycles. University leadership appreciates her attention to risk but pushes for higher partnership volume. Industry partners note she "asks good questions but takes time to close." [3 partner interviews + 2 internal stakeholder interviews]

### Layer 3: Activities and Challenges (What They Do and Struggle With)

**Tasks/Activities:**
- Evaluate partnership proposals for strategic fit and risk (3-4/week, ~6 hours)
- Monitor active project milestones and intervention needs (15+ projects)
- Facilitate partner communication and conflict resolution (ongoing)
- Report validation metrics and ROI to university leadership (quarterly)
- Negotiate terms and manage contract lifecycle (2-3 active negotiations)
- Onboard new partners and set expectations (~8/year)

**Pains/Lacks:**
- **40% of validation time** spent recreating data partners already collected [6/8 interviews]
- No standardized framework causes inconsistent evaluation across projects [8/8 interviews]
- Partners unclear on validation requirements until late stages, causing rework [5/8 interviews]
- Manual tracking across spreadsheets prone to errors and version conflicts [7/8 interviews]
- Limited visibility into portfolio health without manual compilation [4/8 interviews]
- Difficult to compare validation approaches across projects [6/8 interviews]

**Expectations/Hopes:**
- Reduce redundant data collection by 50%, freeing time for relationship building
- Standardize validation framework across all partnerships for consistency
- Give partners clarity on requirements from project start to reduce friction
- Automate progress tracking with real-time dashboards for portfolio visibility
- Enable data-driven decisions about resource allocation across projects
- Achieve 90%+ partner satisfaction on process clarity [Currently 72%]

### Layer 4: Current Solutions (Their Present Reality)

**Current Solutions:**
Currently uses a combination of custom Excel trackers (one per project, no standardization), email chains for partner communication (average 47 emails per project in first 3 months), and annual surveys for satisfaction data (23% response rate). The fragmentation means she can't quickly assess portfolio health or compare validation approaches across projects—simple questions like "which projects are at risk?" require hours of manual compilation.

Previous attempt to standardize using SharePoint was abandoned after 6 months due to poor partner adoption (only 3 of 12 partners used it regularly). Partners found it "clunky" and reverted to email. The failure made her cautious about new system introductions without clear partner value proposition.

She considered three commercial platforms but found them either too expensive ($50K+/year), too inflexible for academic contexts, or lacking validation-specific features. [Evaluated: IdeaScale, Hype Innovation, Planview]

**Why Open to Alternatives:**
Growing pressure from leadership to improve commercialization rates (target: 15% by 2026, currently 8%) while maintaining partnership volume. Peer institution implemented structured validation and reported 40% reduction in time-to-commercialization. Board approved budget for process improvement in next fiscal year.

### Key Quotes

**On Validation Gaps:**
> "I know we're not best-in-class on this, but I can't stop to fix the plane while flying it." —Sarah, INT-001

> "Every partner seems to want different documentation. I end up recreating reports three times for the same data." —Jennifer, INT-003

**On Partner Experience:**
> "We appreciate Sarah's thoroughness, but the timeline to get started was longer than expected. We almost went with [competitor university]." —David, INT-004

> "The onboarding process was unclear. We didn't know what was expected until we were already behind." —Amanda, INT-007

**On Portfolio Management:**
> "When leadership asks me 'which projects are at risk?', I need half a day to compile that answer. It should be instant." —Sarah, INT-001

> "I have fifteen spreadsheets open at any given time. Something will fall through the cracks eventually." —Robert, INT-006

### Behavioral Observations
- Sarah checked phone twice during interview to address partner escalation (INT-001)
- Three different spreadsheet naming conventions across five projects reviewed
- Email thread shown with 47 messages in first 12 weeks of partnership (INT-004 documentation)
- Partner satisfaction survey showed 72% satisfaction on "process clarity" (lowest dimension)

## Quality Assessment

### Score: 4/5 (Strong)

**Strengths:**
- 8 interviews providing multiple perspectives (partner + internal + peer)
- Direct quotes supporting key claims
- Quantified pain points (40% time, 47 emails, 72% satisfaction)
- Specific current solutions named with detailed gap analysis
- Clear behavioral observations

**Gaps for Score 5:**
- Additional 2-3 partner interviews would strengthen external perspective
- Could quantify more pain points (cost of manual compilation)
- Layer 4 competitor analysis could be deeper
- Longitudinal data on partnership outcomes would strengthen claims

**Recommendations:**
1. Conduct 2 additional partner interviews focused on onboarding friction
2. Quantify cost of manual portfolio compilation (hours → dollars)
3. Document specific features missing from evaluated platforms
4. Track before/after metrics if solution implemented

### Distinctiveness Check
This persona is distinct from:
- **Technology Transfer Officers** - Sarah manages partnerships, not IP licensing
- **Research PIs** - Sarah manages portfolio, not individual research
- **Industry Partners** - Sarah represents university side

No significant overlap with other personas in set.
