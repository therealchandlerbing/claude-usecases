# Strategic Persona Builder - Quick Start

Generate evidence-backed personas from research data in 5 minutes.

---

## 5 Steps to Your First Persona Set

### Step 1: Gather Your Data (1 min)
Collect any of these:
- Interview transcripts or survey responses
- Meeting notes or observation documents
- User research reports or case studies
- Project documentation with stakeholder insights

**Tip:** More data = higher quality score. 5-10 interviews per persona achieves Score 4.

### Step 2: Choose Your Framework (30 sec)

| Framework | Best For | Use When |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Vianeo** (default) | Technology validation, platform submissions | You need four-layer structure with dual outputs |
| **Jobs-to-be-Done** | Product development, feature prioritization | You need to understand jobs users hire products for |
| **Empathy Mapping** | Team alignment, design workshops | You need quick visual reference for teams |

### Step 3: Identify Persona Type (30 sec)

- **Partner** - Organizations you collaborate with
- **Innovator** - Technology creators you're validating
- **Stakeholder** - Decision-makers and funders
- **Beneficiary** - End users and impact recipients
- **Customer** - Buyers in commercial contexts

### Step 4: Invoke the Skill (1 min)

**Basic invocation:**
```
Build [persona type] personas from this research data using [framework].
```

**Example invocations:**
```
"Build partner personas from these 8 interview transcripts using Vianeo format."

"Create customer personas using Jobs-to-be-Done framework from these survey responses."

"Generate beneficiary empathy maps from this user research."

"I need Vianeo stakeholder personas for our validation submission. Here are 6 interviews."
```

### Step 5: Review and Iterate (2 min)

**Check your outputs:**
1. **Quality score** - Is it 3+ for adequate, 4+ for strong?
2. **Validation markers** - Which elements are validated vs. inferred?
3. **Distinctiveness** - Are personas genuinely different?
4. **Research gaps** - What needs more validation?

**Common iterations:**
- "Strengthen evidence for Persona 2's pain points"
- "Make Personas 3 and 4 more distinct"
- "Add more specificity to current solutions"
- "Generate validation questions for inferred elements"

## Common Invocations

### Vianeo Submissions
```
"Build Vianeo personas from these [X] interview transcripts.
Show both strategic and platform-ready versions.
Target Score 4+ for competitive submission."
```

### Product Research
```
"Analyze these customer interviews using Jobs-to-be-Done.
Focus on functional and emotional jobs.
Include pain points blocking job completion."
```

### Research Planning
```
"Create hypothesis personas for [audience] to guide interview strategy.
Mark everything as needing validation.
Generate specific validation questions per persona."
```

### Team Alignment
```
"Build empathy maps from these user research sessions.
Quick reference format for the design team.
Include key quotes for each quadrant."
```

### Mixed Framework
```
"Create stakeholder personas using Vianeo structure.
Include JTBD job statements for each persona.
Focus on decision-making triggers and information needs."
```

## What to Expect

### Strategic Version Output
- Complete framework structure (2-3 sentences per field)
- Evidence appendix with sourced quotes
- Quality score with justification
- Gap analysis and recommendations
- ~2,000-3,000 words per persona

### Platform-Ready Version Output
- Condensed, constraint-compliant format
- Character counts verified (need statements <60 chars)
- Copy-paste ready structure
- Validation badges
- ~500-800 words per persona

### Quality Assessment
- Score (1-5) with specific criteria match
- Strength analysis (what's working)
- Gap analysis (what needs improvement)
- Research recommendations (interview counts, question types)

## Framework Quick Reference

### Vianeo Four-Layer Structure

**Layer 1: Requester (Who They Are)**
- First name, age (specific, not ranges)
- Life/Motivations (2-3 sentences)
- Personality/Values (2-3 sentences)

**Layer 2: Field of Application (Their World)**
- Thinks/Feels (2-3 sentences)
- Observes (2-3 sentences)
- Does (2-3 sentences)
- Others Say (2-3 sentences)

**Layer 3: Activities and Challenges**
- Tasks/Activities (4-6 bullets)
- Pains/Lacks (4-6 bullets)
- Expectations/Hopes (4-6 bullets)

**Layer 4: Current Solutions**
- Current Solutions (2-3 sentences)
- Why inadequate, specific gaps

### Jobs-to-be-Done Structure

- **Functional jobs** - Tasks to accomplish
- **Emotional jobs** - Feelings to achieve
- **Social jobs** - How they want to be perceived
- **Pain points** - Obstacles to job completion
- **Gains** - Desired outcomes beyond basic

### Empathy Map Structure

- **Says** - Direct quotes and statements
- **Thinks** - Private thoughts and concerns
- **Does** - Observable behaviors and actions
- **Feels** - Emotional state and reactions

## Quality Score Quick Reference

| Score | Interviews | Key Indicator | Typical Badge |
|-------|------------|---------------|---------------|
| 5 | 10+ | Quantified pain points, direct quotes | Exceptional |
| 4 | 5-10 | Good behavioral detail, distinct personas | Strong |
| 3 | 3-5 | Basic information, some overlap okay | Adequate |
| 2 | 1-2 | Limited detail, significant overlap | Needs Validation |
| 1 | 0 | Hypothesis only, no evidence | Not Validated |

---

## Troubleshooting

### "My personas overlap too much"
- Consider consolidating into fewer segments
- Look for genuinely different needs/behaviors
- Ask skill to highlight distinctions or recommend merging

### "Score is lower than expected"
- Check interview count (5-10 per persona for Score 4)
- Review if quotes are available
- Check if pain points are specific vs. generic

### "Too much is marked as inferred"
- You need more direct stakeholder feedback
- Use generated validation questions to plan research
- Hybrid mode shows which elements need validation

### "Platform-ready version is too long"
- Character limits are automatically enforced
- Check that need statements are under 60 characters
- Strategic version has full detail for reference

### "Need different framework"
- Specify framework in invocation
- Can mix frameworks (e.g., "Vianeo structure with JTBD job statements")
- Empathy maps work for quick team reference

## Core Principles

1. **Evidence over assumption** - Every claim traces to source
2. **Specificity over generality** - Concrete behaviors, not traits
3. **Distinctiveness matters** - Consolidate overlapping personas
4. **Honest quality reporting** - Gaps flagged, not hidden
5. **Dual outputs** - Strategic depth + platform constraints
6. **Research planning** - Validation questions are valuable output
