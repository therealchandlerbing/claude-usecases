# Strategic Persona Builder

Transform research data into evidence-backed stakeholder personas using structured frameworks.

## Overview

The Strategic Persona Builder synthesizes interview transcripts, surveys, behavioral patterns, and organizational context into actionable personas. It supports multiple frameworks (Vianeo, Jobs-to-be-Done, empathy mapping) and produces dual outputs: detailed strategic versions for team alignment and condensed platform-ready versions for system entry.

Unlike generic persona tools, this skill:
- Enforces evidence tracking with source attribution
- Distinguishes validated insights from inferred hypotheses
- Flags quality gaps with specific improvement pathways
- Scores personas against rigorous validation rubrics
- Prevents overlapping, undifferentiated personas

## Key Capabilities

- **Multi-framework support**: Vianeo four-layer, Jobs-to-be-Done, empathy mapping, or hybrid
- **Five persona types**: Partners, innovators, stakeholders, beneficiaries, customers
- **Validation tracking**: Every claim marked as validated or inferred with evidence
- **Quality scoring**: 1-5 scale with specific criteria and improvement pathways
- **Dual outputs**: Strategic depth + platform-ready constraints
- **Research planning**: Generate validation questions for hypothesis personas

## When to Use

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Build personas from this research data"
- "Create stakeholder personas for [project]"
- "I need personas in Vianeo format"
- "Jobs-to-be-Done analysis"
- "Empathy mapping from these interviews"

**Best for:**
- Technology validation projects (Vianeo submissions)
- Partnership development and stakeholder mapping
- User research synthesis and documentation
- Product strategy and customer segmentation
- Impact assessment and beneficiary documentation

**Not ideal for:**
- Quick stakeholder summaries (use direct analysis)
- Marketing demographics without behavioral data
- When no research data exists (produces low-quality output)

## Quick Example

**Input:**
```
"I have 7 partner interview transcripts from university collaborators.
Build Vianeo partner personas with both strategic and platform-ready versions."
```

**Output includes:**
- 3 distinct partner personas with complete four-layer structure
- Evidence appendix with quotes from 7 interviews
- Quality score: 4/5 (Strong) with justification
- Platform-ready version with character counts verified
- Recommendations for reaching Score 5

## Core Philosophy

1. **Evidence over assumption** - Every claim traceable to source data
2. **Structure creates insight** - Frameworks reveal gaps and force completeness
3. **Distinctiveness matters** - Fewer sharp personas beat many overlapping ones
4. **Honesty about quality** - Score 2 with clear gaps beats false confidence
5. **Practical over academic** - Personas serve decisions, not documentation

## Getting Started

1. **Gather your data**: Interview transcripts, surveys, meeting notes, or behavioral patterns
2. **Choose your framework**: Vianeo (default), JTBD, empathy mapping, or hybrid
3. **Specify persona type**: Partner, innovator, stakeholder, beneficiary, or customer
4. **Invoke the skill**: Provide context and data, skill handles the rest

See [QUICK-START.md](QUICK-START.md) for detailed walkthrough.

## What You Get

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Raw interview transcripts scattered across files | Synthesized personas with evidence tracking |
| Assumptions about stakeholder needs | Validated insights vs. flagged hypotheses |
| Generic user profiles | Specific behavioral patterns and quotes |
| No quality benchmarks | 1-5 scoring with improvement pathways |
| Single format output | Strategic + platform-ready dual outputs |

## Real-World Use Cases

**Technology Validation:** Build Vianeo partner and beneficiary personas for validation submissions, achieving Score 4+ for competitive positioning.

**Product Development:** Create customer personas using JTBD framework to understand jobs users hire your product to accomplish.

**Research Planning:** Generate hypothesis personas to guide interview design, with specific validation questions per assumption.

**Team Alignment:** Produce empathy maps from user research for quick design team reference.

## Integration

Works well with:
- **Skill Orchestrator** - Complex research workflows
- **360 Client Portfolio Builder** - Personas inform portfolio narratives
- **Open Deep Research Team** - Deep-dive persona research
- **AI Ethics Advisor** - Ensure diverse perspective representation

## Support

**Common issues:**
- *Low quality score?* Check interview count per persona (5-10 for Score 4)
- *Personas overlap?* Consider consolidating into fewer, sharper segments
- *Missing evidence?* Review validation mode markers and suggested research

**Deep documentation:**
- [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) - Complete operational specification
- [QUICK-START.md](QUICK-START.md) - 5-minute onboarding
- [references/](references/) - Framework deep-dives and rubrics
