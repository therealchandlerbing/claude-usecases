## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### Provide Sufficient Context

**Good:**
```
Wearable continuous glucose monitor, Bluetooth to smartphone, alerts for high/low glucose,
for Type 1 diabetics, similar to Dexcom G7 but with extended wear time (14 days vs 10 days).
```

**Not Enough:**
```
Glucose monitor.
```

### Be Specific About Your Situation

**Good:**
```
We're a startup with a prototype, validated in benchtop testing, planning pilot clinical study.
Need to know FDA pathway before raising Series A funding.
```

**Not Enough:**
```
What do we need to do for FDA?
```

### Ask Follow-Up Questions

After initial guidance, dig deeper:
- "Can you help identify specific predicate devices?"
- "What testing standards apply to this device?"
- "What should be in our Pre-Submission meeting request?"
- "Can you review our proposed intended use statement?"

### Reference Specific Regulations When Needed

If you're already familiar with FDA regulations:
```
Our device seems to fit under 21 CFR 880.5725 (surgical marker).
Can you confirm and explain submission requirements?
```
