4. **Review Implementation Steps**: See how actionable next steps are provided

### Applying to Your Situation

1. **Find Similar Example**: Identify example closest to your product/situation
2. **Adapt Query Pattern**: Use example query structure for your product
3. **Compare Responses**: Note similarities and differences in recommendations
4. **Ask Follow-ups**: Use examples to formulate detailed follow-up questions

### Key Elements in Every Example

Each consultation example includes:

✅ **Initial Assessment**: Quick regulatory context setting
✅ **Regulatory Framework**: Specific CFR citations and guidance documents
✅ **Strategic Recommendations**: Clear pathway recommendations with rationale
✅ **Implementation Steps**: Actionable timeline and next steps
✅ **Critical Considerations**: Risks, success factors, and mitigation strategies

## Example Categories Explained

### Classification Examples
**Purpose:** Determine FDA device class or drug pathway
**When to Use:** New product development, unclear regulatory status
**Typical Timeline:** Immediate classification for established devices, 1-3 months for novel products

### Submission Examples
**Purpose:** Prepare FDA submissions (510(k), PMA, IND, NDA, etc.)
**When to Use:** Planning regulatory submission, preparing application
**Typical Timeline:** 3-18 months depending on pathway

### Compliance Examples
**Purpose:** Assess and improve QSR/GMP compliance
**When to Use:** Quality system implementation, inspection preparation, remediation
**Typical Timeline:** Ongoing compliance, 3-12 months for major improvements

### Meeting Preparation Examples
**Purpose:** Prepare for FDA meetings and communications
**When to Use:** Before Q-Sub, Pre-Sub, Type A/B/C meetings
**Typical Timeline:** 1-3 months preparation, 30-90 day FDA response

## Cross-Referencing Examples

Many regulatory scenarios combine multiple categories:

**Example: Novel Medical Device Launch**
1. **Classification** → Determine device class and pathway
2. **Testing Strategy** → Plan required performance and clinical testing
3. **Submission Preparation** → Prepare 510(k) or PMA application
4. **FDA Meeting** → Pre-Submission to confirm approach
5. **Submission** → File and respond to FDA questions
6. **Quality System** → Ensure QSR compliance before clearance/approval

Use examples from each category to build comprehensive regulatory strategy.

## Tips for Getting the Most from Examples

**Do:**
- Read multiple examples in your category
- Note patterns in FDA requirements
- Adapt example queries to your specific product
- Use examples to identify gaps in your current approach
- Cross-reference cited guidance documents

**Don't:**
- Assume your product is identical to example
- Skip reading entire response (critical considerations are important!)
- Ignore dated guidance or regulations (verify currency)
- Use examples as substitute for product-specific consultation

## Requesting Additional Examples

If you'd like to see examples for specific scenarios not currently covered:
1. Identify the category (classification, submission, compliance, meetings)
2. Describe the product type and regulatory question
3. Submit request through appropriate feedback channels

Priority will be given to:
- High-frequency scenarios
- Novel technologies with emerging frameworks
- Complex multi-pathway situations
- International harmonization scenarios
