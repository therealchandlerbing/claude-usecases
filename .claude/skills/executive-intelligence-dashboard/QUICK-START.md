# Quick Start Guide

**Get your first executive brief in under 5 minutes.**

## One-Sentence Summary

Ask Claude to "Generate this week's 360 Impact Brief" and you'll receive a publication-quality HTML dashboard synthesizing your Asana, Gmail, and Google Drive data into strategic intelligence.

## Prerequisites

Before your first brief, ensure Claude has access to:
- ✅ Asana workspace (360socialventures.com)
- ✅ Gmail account for partnership communications
- ✅ Google Drive for strategic documents

If any tools are missing, enable them in your Claude settings.

## Your First Brief (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Request the Brief

Simply ask:
```
Generate this week's 360 Impact Brief
```

Or be more specific:
```
Generate an executive brief for this week with focus on partnerships and team updates
```

### Step 2: Wait for Processing

Claude will:
1. Search your Asana workspace for projects, tasks, and updates (2-5 minutes)
2. Query Gmail for partnership communications and client engagement (2-5 minutes)
3. Search Google Drive for strategic documents and planning materials (1-3 minutes)
4. Synthesize data, prioritize developments, and generate the brief (3-7 minutes)

Total time: 15-25 minutes for a comprehensive brief.

You'll see Claude working through each phase with progress updates.

### Step 3: Download and Review

Claude will provide:
- A brief summary (3-5 bullets) of key developments
- A link to download the HTML file
- Notes on any information gaps or limitations

## What You'll See

The brief contains:

**Executive Summary** (blue banner at top):
- Three strategic insights covering inflection points, partnerships, and team

**Three Main Sections** (color-coded):
- 🟣 Partnerships & Business Development (purple headers)
- 🟢 Operations & Team (green headers)
- 🟠 Strategy & Governance (amber headers)

**Timeline** (bottom):
- Week-ahead view of critical meetings and milestones

**Interactive Features**:
- Left sidebar navigation (click to jump between sections)
- Charts and visualizations (hover for details)
- Action items with owners and deadlines

## First-Time Review Checklist

When you open your first brief, check:

- [ ] Does the executive summary highlight the most important developments?
- [ ] Are all major partnerships represented?
- [ ] Is team composition accurate?
- [ ] Do the visualizations show correct data?
- [ ] Are action items assigned to the right people?
- [ ] Is the timeline complete with upcoming events?

If anything seems off, ask Claude to refine specific sections.

## Common First-Time Issues

**Issue**: Brief feels incomplete or generic
**Fix**: Make sure your Asana projects have recent updates and Google Drive has current strategic documents

**Issue**: Missing specific partnership information
**Fix**: Check that partnership emails are in Gmail and partnership names are searchable

**Issue**: Charts show placeholder data
**Fix**: Verify that Asana custom fields are populated (Priority, Revenue Impact, Partnership Type)

**Issue**: Action items seem random
**Fix**: Review Asana tasks to ensure high-priority items have clear owners and due dates

## Customization for Next Time

After reviewing your first brief, you can request:

**More Depth on Specific Topics**:
```
Generate this week's brief with detailed analysis of CNEN and NanoBioPlus partnerships
```

**Different Time Ranges**:
```
Generate a monthly executive brief covering all of November
```

**Focused Sections**:
```
Generate a partnership-only brief for the board meeting
```

**Emergency Briefs** (when time-limited):
```
Generate a condensed executive summary covering only critical developments
```

## Weekly Workflow

Once you're comfortable with the system:

**Thursday/Friday**:
- Update Asana with week's accomplishments
- Ensure strategic emails are in Gmail
- Upload any new documents to Google Drive

**Friday Afternoon**:
- Request the executive brief
- Review for accuracy and completeness
- Refine specific sections if needed

**Sunday**:
- Use for board meetings or weekly planning
- Share with stakeholders as appropriate

**Monday**:
- Distribute to team or advisory board
- Use as basis for week-ahead priorities

## Tips for Best Results

**Be Specific About Context**: Mention if you're preparing for a board meeting, investor call, or strategy session. This helps prioritize relevant information.

**Provide Date Ranges**: Default is the past week, but specify other ranges when needed ("past two weeks," "month of November").

**Request Iterations**: Don't settle for the first draft. Ask Claude to expand sections, add detail, or refine specific content.

**Keep Data Current**: The brief quality depends on your operational data. Regular Asana updates and organized email make a big difference.

**Review Before Sharing**: Always review for accuracy before distributing to stakeholders. This is intelligence synthesis, not a fully automated report.

## Next Steps

- **Generate your first brief** using the simple request above
- **Read WORKFLOW-EXAMPLE.md** to see a complete walkthrough with sample data
- **Check QUERY-GUIDE.md** to understand how data is collected
- **Review IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md** for technical details

## Getting Help

If your first brief doesn't meet expectations:

1. Review this guide's troubleshooting section
2. Check that all data sources are accessible
3. Ask Claude to explain what data was found and what was missing
4. Request refinements to specific sections rather than regenerating from scratch

Most issues are data availability or search scope, not skill problems.

## Success Indicators

You'll know the skill is working well when:
- Strategic developments are clearly highlighted (not buried in details)
- You can understand your organization's position in 5 minutes
- Board members or investors could present from this brief
- Action items are specific and well-assigned
- Visual quality matches enterprise SaaS tools
