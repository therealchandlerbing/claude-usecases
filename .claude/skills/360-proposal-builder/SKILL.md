# 360 Proposal Builder Skill

## Purpose

This skill enables Claude to generate executive-grade proposals for 360 Social Impact Studios' innovation transformation services. Every proposal reflects the company's values, methodology, and strategic positioning while being tailored to specific client contexts, with proper attribution to methodology partners.

## Core Capabilities

**Strategic Proposal Generation**: Create customized proposals that position 360 as a strategic partner (not vendor), with clear value propositions tailored to client challenges.

**Service Portfolio Mastery**: Navigate three complete service tracks (Innovation Assessment, Business Design, Leadership & Culture) with accurate pricing, deliverables, and positioning.

**GenIP Attribution Compliance**: Ensure proper crediting of GenIP methodology partnership and institutional trust, preventing false claims about client relationships.

**Cultural Adaptation**: Adjust tone, timeline expectations, and relationship framing for clients across North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific.

**Template Customization**: Transform pre-structured templates into client-specific proposals with appropriate discovery insights, case examples, and pricing.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Client requests a formal proposal after discovery conversation
- Scoping call identifies specific innovation challenges requiring written proposal
- Partnership opportunities require documented service offerings
- RFP responses need 360's methodology and pricing
- Board-level presentations require executive summary format
- Need to select appropriate service track for client situation
- Creating pricing packages or bundled offerings

Do NOT use this skill for:
- Simple service inquiries that don't require full proposals
- Contract negotiation or redlining (use contract-redlining-tool)
- Email communications (use smart-email-composer)
- Client project tracking or status updates
- Questions about 360's internal operations

## Company Identity

**Name:** 360 Social Impact Studios
**Location:** Seattle, WA
**Tagline:** "Connecting Worlds, Building Futures" / "Unindo mundos e construindo o futuro"
**Managing Director:** Chandler Lewis (chandler@360socialventures.com)

### Mission & Positioning

360 Social Impact Studios is a venture studio specializing in systemic innovation transformation for universities, corporations, and governments. Unlike traditional consultancies or accelerators, 360 delivers:
- Tangible business results (not theories)
- Sustainable growth
- Cultural impact
- Global frameworks with local implementation
- Connections between Global South and Global North

### Core Values (Apply When Relevant to Client Context)

1. **Innovation with Purpose:** Cutting-edge solutions creating lasting impact
2. **Sustainable Impact:** Long-term value for society and environment
3. **Global Vision, Local Impact:** Holistic approach resonating globally
4. **Adaptability by Design:** Flexibility for social innovation complexity
5. **Empowering Partnerships:** Co-creation with clients and partners

## Critical: GenIP Attribution Requirements

### The Core Language Pattern

**Always use: "Our methodology from GenIP" or "The GenIP methodology we use"**

This makes it crystal clear that:
- GenIP is the source of the methodology
- 360 uses (not owns) this methodology
- The track record and institutional trust belong to the methodology
- 360's value is in how we deliver and apply it

### GenIP Relationship

**GenIP is 360's core methodology partner, NOT a 360 product.**

- GenIP provides the assessment methodologies and tools
- 360 delivers services using GenIP methodologies
- The 6,000+ assessments track record comes from GenIP methodology usage across organizations
- Always reference GenIP as "Core Methodology Partner" in partner lists

### Institutional Trust Language

**These institutions trust the GenIP METHODOLOGY, not 360 as an organization.**

**CORRECT:**
- "Our methodology from GenIP has guided portfolio decisions for 250+ organizations including MIT, Oxford..."
- "The GenIP methodology we use has guided decisions at MIT, Oxford..."
- "Using GenIP's proven methodology, trusted by MIT, Oxford..."
- "360's Innovation Compass uses the GenIP assessment methodology, which has guided..."

**INCORRECT:**
- "Trusted by MIT, Oxford, University of Washington..." (implies they're 360 clients)
- "360 clients include MIT, Oxford..." (false claim)
- "Our clients at MIT..." (false claim)
- "Our methodology has guided..." (without crediting GenIP as the source)

### Standard Social Proof Block

Use this in all proposals:

"**Our methodology from GenIP** has guided portfolio decisions for 250+ organizations including MIT, Oxford, University of Washington, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Brazilian Nuclear Energy Commission, and innovation-driven organizations worldwide."

"**Track Record:** 6,000+ assessments across 250 organizations globally using GenIP methodology, from Fortune 500 to leading research universities"

### Strategic Partners List

"**Strategic Partners:** GenIP (Core Methodology Partner), AgeTech Collaborative (AARP), CNEN, Yale School of Nursing, Cosinfinity, theSPACE, Inova.USP, MOSO, University of Washington School of Nursing, ANTHROPIC, Vianeo, NVIDIA, Avatar Partners, bgoventures, Harvard HealthLab Accelerators, CAOS Focado, WSMA, Capstone UW School, LPCE, Digilens, Realwear"

**Do:**
- Speak to specific outcomes and deliverables
- Show you understand their unique situation
- Make pricing transparent and justified
- Give clear decision pathways
- Anticipate implementation questions
- Position as strategic investment (not cost)

3. **Cultural sensitivity matters**: International deals require different approaches. Adjust tone, timeline, and relationship framing.

5. **Transparency builds trust**: No surprises on pricing. Make the full commitment clear upfront.

6. **Make it easy to say yes**: Always provide pilot options and clear decision pathways.

7. **Client language over our jargon**: Reflect the client's words back to them. They should see themselves in the proposal.
