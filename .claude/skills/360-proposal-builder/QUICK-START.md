# Quick Start Guide: 360 Proposal Builder

## Step 1: Gather Discovery Information

Before creating any proposal, collect:

**Client Basics:**
- Organization name and type
- Geographic location
- Industry/sector

**The Challenge:**
- What innovation initiatives are active?
- How are decisions made today?
- What's driving urgency?

**Constraints:**
- Budget range
- Timeline requirements
- Key decision-makers

## Step 2: Select the Right Template

### Innovation Assessment (Template 1)
**Use when client needs:** Portfolio prioritization, decision clarity, triage
**Budget:** $15K-$55K
**Primary service:** Innovation Compass

### Business Design (Template 2)
**Use when client needs:** Venture building, validation, execution
**Budget:** $6.5K-$80K
**Primary services:** Opportunity Sprint through Industry Custom Lab

### Leadership & Culture (Template 3)
**Use when client needs:** Capability building, training, transformation
**Budget:** $8K-$100K
**Primary services:** Vianeo Intensive through Sector Learning Lab

## Step 3: Required GenIP Attribution

**Always use this pattern:**

"Our methodology from GenIP has guided portfolio decisions for 250+ organizations including MIT, Oxford, University of Washington, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Brazilian Nuclear Energy Commission, and innovation-driven organizations worldwide."

**Never claim:**
- MIT, Oxford, etc. as 360 clients
- "Our methodology" without crediting GenIP

## Step 4: Cultural Adjustments

**Latin America (Brazil):** Emphasize relationships, consider Portuguese, use CCBC arbitration
**Europe:** Emphasize ISO 56002, formal documentation, structured frameworks
**North America:** Emphasize ROI, speed to results, efficiency
**APAC:** Research hierarchy norms, allow relationship-building time

## Step 5: Quality Check

Before finalizing:

- [ ] GenIP attribution is correct
- [ ] NO em dashes in document
- [ ] Pricing is transparent
- [ ] Deliverables are specific
- [ ] Next steps are actionable
- [ ] Cultural considerations applied
