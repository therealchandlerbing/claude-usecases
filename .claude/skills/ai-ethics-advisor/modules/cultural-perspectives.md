## Global South Considerations

AI ethics must address power imbalances and historical inequities between Global North and Global South.

### Data Colonialism

**Problem:**
- Extraction of data from Global South to benefit Global North
- AI systems trained on Global North data, deployed globally
- Local context and knowledge devalued
- Economic benefits accrue elsewhere
- Infrastructure and power concentrated in Global North

**Examples:**
- Western tech companies extracting user data from Global South
- AI models trained primarily on English and Western cultural norms
- Gig economy platforms extracting value from Global South labor
- Medical data from Global South used to develop drugs sold at high prices

**Addressing Data Colonialism:**
- Local data sovereignty and ownership
- Value sharing and fair compensation
- Local capacity building for AI development
- Culturally appropriate and locally developed systems
- Regulation requiring local benefit from local data

### Infrastructure Disparities

**Challenges:**

**Computational Resources:**
- Unequal access to computing power and cloud services
- High costs of AI development infrastructure
- Dependence on Global North cloud providers
- Energy costs and availability

**Connectivity:**
- Limited internet access and bandwidth
- Mobile-first access patterns
- Intermittent connectivity
- Cost of data

**Device Limitations:**
- Older or less powerful devices
- Feature phones vs smartphones
- Shared devices
- Limited storage

**Technical Capacity:**
- AI literacy gaps

- Enable local decision-making

### Balancing Universal and Particular

**Universal Ethical Principles:**
Some principles have broad cross-cultural support:
- Human dignity and respect
- Non-harm
- Justice and fairness
- Transparency and honesty
- Accountability

**Culturally Specific:**
Implementation details and priorities vary:
- Individual vs. collective emphasis
- Privacy boundaries
- Authority and hierarchy
- Consent models
- Remediation approaches

**Approach:**
