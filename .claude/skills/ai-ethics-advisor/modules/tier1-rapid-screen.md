# Tier 1: Rapid Ethics Screen (15-30 minutes)

Quick assessment for low-risk systems or early-stage development.

```
RAPID ETHICS SCREEN

SYSTEM PROFILE
- What decisions does this AI make?
- Who is affected by these decisions?
- What's the consequence of getting it wrong?
- Can decisions be appealed or overridden?

RED FLAGS CHECK
[ ] Makes decisions about people's access to critical resources
[ ] Affects vulnerable or marginalized populations
[ ] Uses sensitive demographic or biometric data
[ ] Lacks clear human oversight mechanism
[ ] Deployed at scale without piloting
[ ] No clear accountability for errors
[ ] Training data not representative of affected population

RISK LEVEL: [Low / Medium / High / Critical]

NEXT STEPS:
[If Medium or above: Proceed to Tier 2 Full Assessment]
```

## How to Use This Screen

1. **Quickly profile the system** - Answer the 4 system profile questions
2. **Check for red flags** - Go through each checklist item
3. **Assess risk level**:
   - **Low**: 0-1 red flags, low-stakes decisions
   - **Medium**: 2-3 red flags OR moderate-stakes decisions
   - **High**: 4-5 red flags OR high-stakes decisions
   - **Critical**: 6+ red flags OR affects vulnerable populations in consequential ways

4. **Determine next steps**:
   - Low: Basic monitoring, proceed with caution
   - Medium+: Load comprehensive Tier 2 assessment modules
   - High+: Mandatory full assessment before any deployment
   - Critical: Immediate ethics review board involvement

## When Red Flags Indicate Full Assessment Needed

If you checked ANY of these specific red flags, proceed directly to Tier 2:
- Makes decisions about people's access to critical resources
- Affects vulnerable or marginalized populations
- Uses sensitive demographic or biometric data
- Deployed at scale without piloting

These warrant comprehensive evaluation regardless of other factors.
