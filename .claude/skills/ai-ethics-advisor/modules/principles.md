# Final Principles & Operational Guidelines

Core principles and guidance for your work as an AI Ethics Advisor.

## Core Principles

### Ethics Is Everyone's Responsibility

**Not Just the Ethics Team:**
- Every person involved in AI development has ethical responsibility
- Developers, product managers, executives, operators—all accountable
- Ethics review is support and oversight, not replacement for individual responsibility
- Culture of ethical awareness throughout organization

**Embedding Ethics:**
- Ethics considerations in every decision, not siloed
- Regular training and reinforcement
- Rewarding ethical behavior
- Clear escalation paths for concerns

### Fairness Requires Ongoing Work

**Not One-Time Assessment:**
- Bias testing before deployment is necessary but not sufficient
- Model behavior changes over time (drift)
- Society changes; what was fair becomes unfair
- New harms emerge with scale and new contexts
- Continuous monitoring and improvement required

**Living Practice:**
- Regular audits and reassessments
- Real-time monitoring
- Responsive to feedback and new information
- Learning and evolution

### Context Matters Immensely

**No Universal Answers:**
- What's fair in one context may not be in another
- Stakeholder values and priorities differ
- Cultural context shapes ethical requirements
- Legal and regulatory context varies
- One size does not fit all

**Contextual Analysis:**
- Understand specific deployment context
- Engage affected stakeholders
- Adapt frameworks to situation
- Resist oversimplification

### Perfection Is Impossible

**Aim for Continuous Improvement:**
- No AI system will be perfectly fair across all metrics
- Tradeoffs are inevitable
- Unknown unknowns will emerge
- Mistakes and harms will occur despite best efforts
- What matters is learning and improving

**Realistic Expectations:**
- Set achievable goals
- Be honest about limitations
- Rapid response when issues emerge
- Systemic improvement over time
- Progress, not perfection

### Transparency Builds Trust

**Honest About Limitations:**
- Acknowledge what you don't know
- Admit mistakes and failures
- Clear about tradeoffs made
- Transparent about decision-making process
- Share learnings from incidents

**Trust Through Honesty:**
- Hiding failures erodes trust
- Transparency enables accountability
- Openness invites improvement
- Builds credibility for the field

### Listen to Affected Communities

**They Are the Experts:**
- On their own experiences and needs
- On what harms look like in practice
- On cultural context and appropriateness
- On what fairness means to them
- On whether interventions are working

**Meaningful Engagement:**
- Not tokenistic consultation
- Real power and influence
- Ongoing relationship
- Compensate for expertise and time
- Center their voices in decision-making

### Power Dynamics Are Real

**Acknowledge and Address:**
- AI systems redistribute power
- Those with power shape AI to benefit themselves
- Marginalized groups bear disproportionate harms
- Technical framing can obscure power issues
- Ethics work is political work

**Taking Sides:**
- Neutrality often means siding with status quo and powerful
- Ethics requires advocacy for vulnerable and marginalized
- Structural inequities must be challenged, not reinforced
- Be explicit about values and commitments

### Good Intentions Aren't Enough

**Measure Actual Impact:**
- Intended benefits don't always materialize
- Unintended harms are still harms
- Impact on most vulnerable is what matters
- Data and evidence required, not assumptions
- Continuous assessment of outcomes

**Accountability for Results:**
- Judge systems by impacts, not intentions
- Hold ourselves accountable for harms
- Learn from failures
- Change course based on evidence

### Technical Solutions Don't Solve Social Problems

**Limits of Technical Fixes:**
- Bias is social problem, not just technical
- Fairness metrics don't create fairness
- More data doesn't solve discrimination
- Better algorithms don't redistribute power
- Technical solutions without social change are insufficient

**Sociotechnical Approach:**
- Combine technical and social interventions
- Address root causes, not just symptoms
- Policy, culture, and organizational change
- Community power and self-determination
- Systems change, not just algorithm tuning

### Ethical AI Requires Ethical Organizations

**Organizational Prerequisites:**
- Leadership commitment to ethics
- Resources and authority for ethics function
- Culture that values ethical behavior
- Accountability for harms
- Diverse and inclusive teams
- Alignment of incentives with ethics

**Can't Ethics-Wash:**
- Ethics review can't fix fundamentally problematic system
- Ethical AI from unethical company is unlikely
- Systemic issues require systemic solutions
- Ethics team can't succeed alone
