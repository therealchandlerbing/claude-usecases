- Date received
- Vendor name
- Invoice number
- Invoice amount
- PO number (if referenced)

**6.1.3** Scan physical invoices to PDF (300 dpi, searchable).

1. Navigate to Transactions > Purchases > Match Bills to POs
2. Search by PO number or vendor name
3. Verify three-way match:
   - PO quantity ≥ Invoice quantity
   - PO unit price = Invoice unit price
   - Goods/services received

**IF** three-way match succeeds:
→ Proceed to Step 6.3 (Approval Routing)

**IF** quantity or price variance exists:
→ Determine if within tolerance (±5% or $100, whichever is greater)
→ IF within tolerance: Proceed with note
→ IF outside tolerance: Contact requestor for resolution

**IF** no PO exists:
→ Route to department manager for non-PO approval
→ Flag for procurement policy follow-up

#### 6.3 Approval Routing

**6.3.1** System automatically routes based on amount:

| Invoice Amount | Approval Required | Max Time |
|----------------|-------------------|----------|
| $0 - $4,999.99 | Department Manager | 48 hours |
| $5,000 - $24,999.99 | Director | 48 hours |
| $25,000+ | Vice President | 72 hours |

**6.3.2** Monitor approval queue daily:
- Check for invoices pending >24 hours
- Send reminder to approver
- Escalate if approaching payment deadline

#### 6.4 Approval Review

**6.4.1** Approver reviews invoice in NetSuite:
1. Open invoice from Approval Queue
2. Verify against PO/contract
3. Confirm goods/services received
4. Check budget availability

**6.4.2** Take action:
- **Approve:** Click "Approve" to advance to payment processing
- **Reject:** Click "Reject" with reason; returns to AP for vendor contact
- **Request Info:** Click "Hold" with question; routes back to AP

#### 6.5 Payment Entry

**6.5.1** For approved invoices, enter payment in NetSuite:
1. Navigate to Transactions > Payables > Bills
2. Select vendor
3. Enter invoice details
4. Attach scanned invoice
5. Set payment date based on terms

**6.5.2** Verify GL coding:
