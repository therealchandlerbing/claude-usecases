# Quick Start: Workflow Process Generator

**Get your first professional SOP in 5 minutes.**

---

## Step 1: Identify Your Process (1 minute)

Choose a process you need to document. Good first choices:
- A process you explain repeatedly to new team members
- A procedure that varies depending on who does it
- Something an auditor might ask about

**Example:** "Customer refund processing"

---

## Step 2: Gather Basic Information (2 minutes)

Answer these four questions:

1. **What triggers it?** (e.g., "Customer requests refund")
2. **What's the end result?** (e.g., "Refund issued and logged")
3. **Who does it?** (e.g., "Support team, with Finance approval for >$500")
4. **What tools?** (e.g., "Zendesk, Stripe, Google Sheets")

---

## Step 3: Make Your Request (30 seconds)

Use this format:

```
Create an SOP for [process name].

Trigger: [what starts it]
End: [what completion looks like]
Roles: [who's involved]
Tools: [systems used]
Special requirements: [compliance, approvals, etc.]
```

---

## Example Request

```
Create an SOP for processing customer refunds.

Trigger: Customer requests refund via support ticket
End: Refund issued, ticket closed, logged in tracking sheet
Roles: Support agent (processes), Finance manager (approves >$500)
Tools: Zendesk, Stripe, Google Sheets refund tracker
Special requirements: Must log reason for analytics,
follow up if >$500 for retention attempt
```

1. **Document metadata** - ID, version, owner, dates
2. **Purpose and scope** - Clear boundaries
3. **Roles and responsibilities** - Who does what
4. **Prerequisites** - What's needed before starting
5. **Step-by-step procedure** - Numbered, actionable steps
6. **Decision points** - Clear criteria for choices

## Next Steps

After your first SOP:

1. **Validate** - Walk through with a performer to verify accuracy
2. **Test** - Have someone unfamiliar execute using only the SOP
3. **Refine** - Update based on feedback
4. **Implement** - Train team and track adoption
