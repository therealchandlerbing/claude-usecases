# Quality Frameworks

Risk assessment, metrics, and quality assurance checklists for workflow documentation.

## Risk Assessment Framework

### Process Risk Classification

**Level 1: Critical Risk**

Documentation Requirements:
- Full SOP suite with all appendices
- Detailed process maps
- Training with competency verification
- Regular audits (quarterly)
- Formal change control

---

**Level 2: High Risk**

Characteristics:
- Indirect safety implications
- Moderate financial exposure ($10K-$100K)
- Industry standards apply
- Customer impact potential
- Operational continuity importance

Documentation Requirements:
- Complete SOP with flowcharts
- Role-based training
- Annual reviews
- Change control process

---

**Level 3: Moderate Risk**

Characteristics:
- Quality impact
- Minor financial exposure (<$10K)

Documentation Requirements:
- Standard SOP
- Team training
- Annual reviews
- Simplified change process

---

**Level 4: Low Risk**

Characteristics:
- Administrative processes
- No financial/quality impact
- Convenience/efficiency focus

Documentation Requirements:
- Basic work instruction or job aid
- Informal training
- As-needed reviews

## Quality Metrics and Success Indicators

### Documentation Quality Metrics

**Clarity Score (Target: ≥90%)**
- Measured by: User testing success rate (can users complete process correctly on first attempt using only documentation?)
- Collection method: Walkthrough testing with unfamiliar users

**Completeness Score (Target: 100%)**
- Measured by: Audit checklist compliance
- Collection method: Compliance review against required elements

**Currency Score (Target: 100%)**
- Measured by: Percentage of documents within review cycle
- Collection method: Document control system reporting

**Usability Score (Target: ≥4.0/5.0)**
- Measured by: User satisfaction survey
- Collection method: Post-training and periodic surveys

---

### Business Impact Metrics

**Training Time Reduction**
- Baseline: Time to competency before documentation
- Target: 30-50% reduction in time to competency
- Measurement: Training completion records

**Error Rate Reduction**
- Baseline: Process error rate before documentation
- Target: 50-70% reduction in errors
- Measurement: Quality metrics, deviation reports

**Audit Performance**
- Baseline: Audit findings before documentation
- Target: Zero critical findings, 50% reduction in minor findings
- Measurement: Audit reports

**Process Consistency**
- Baseline: Variation in process execution
- Target: <10% variation between performers
- Measurement: Process observation, output quality metrics

---

### Continuous Improvement Indicators

**Document Utilization**
- Access frequency
- Search patterns
- Time on page
- Feedback submissions

**Process Performance**
- Cycle time trends
- Quality metrics
- Customer satisfaction
- Cost per transaction

## Common Process Documentation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Approval Workflow

Structure for any approval process:
1. Request submission (form/system)
2. Completeness check
3. Routing to approvers
4. Review criteria
5. Approval/rejection/return for info
6. Notification and next steps
7. Audit trail

---

### Pattern 2: Quality Check

Structure for any inspection/verification:
1. What to inspect
2. Acceptance criteria
3. Inspection method
4. Recording results
5. Pass/fail actions
6. Exception handling
7. Documentation requirements

---

### Pattern 3: Customer Interaction

Structure for any customer-facing process:
1. Request intake
2. Validation/triage
3. Processing steps
4. Quality review
5. Customer communication
6. Completion/closure
7. Follow-up

---

### Pattern 4: Data Processing

Structure for any data transformation:
1. Input requirements
2. Validation rules
