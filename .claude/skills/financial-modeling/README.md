# Financial Modeling Suite

**Institutional-Grade Financial Analysis for Innovation Investments**

Transform investment evaluation from manual model building into systematic intelligence generation with Excel models, interactive dashboards, and IC-ready documentation.

- **Investment Analysis**: Multi-scenario models with returns analysis
