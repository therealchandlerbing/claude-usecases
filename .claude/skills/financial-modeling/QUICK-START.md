**Excel Workbook (9 worksheets):**
1. Executive Summary with key metrics
2. Assumptions (all inputs in blue)
3. 5-year financial projections
4. Three scenarios (base, upside, downside)
5. Sensitivity tables
6. Valuation analysis

Change the exit assumption to strategic buyer at 12x
```

## Example Session

**You:**
```
Evaluate HealthTech as a $30M Series B at 10x ARR

Context:
- Digital health platform, $3M ARR
- 100% YoY growth, 75% gross margin
- FDA-cleared, 20 health system customers

Terms:
- 20% ownership, $30M primary
- Board seat, pro-rata rights
- Target 3x in 5 years
```

**Assistant:**
```
I'll build a comprehensive Series B investment analysis for HealthTech.

Phase 1: Gathering data...
- Company financials and metrics
- Digital health market sizing
- Comparable transactions (Livongo, Teladoc acquisitions)
- Healthcare IT public comps

Phase 2: Building model...
- 5-year projections with three scenarios
- Revenue build by customer cohort
- Path to profitability analysis
- Exit scenarios (IPO, strategic, sponsor)

Phase 3: Generating documentation...

[Delivers Excel model and IC memo]

Key Findings:
- Base case: 2.8x MOIC, 23% IRR
- Upside case: 4.2x MOIC, 35% IRR
- Downside case: 1.5x MOIC, 9% IRR

Primary risks:
- Regulatory changes (moderate probability, severe impact)
- Health system budget cycles (high probability, moderate impact)

Recommendation: Attractive risk/reward at current valuation.
