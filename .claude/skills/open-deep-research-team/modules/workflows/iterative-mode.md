# Iterative Workflow

**Trigger**: User requests progressive research or building on previous work

## Process

### Iteration 1: Broad Overview (Express Mode)
- Identify promising areas
- Generate initial findings
- Map the research landscape
- **Time**: 10-20 minutes

### Iteration 2: Deep Dive on Promising Areas (Specialist Focus)
- Comprehensive analysis of selected topics
- Validation and cross-checking
- Detailed findings in priority areas
- **Time**: 20-35 minutes per area

### Iteration 3: Competitive Analysis and Final Validation
- Compare alternatives
- Validate key findings
- Generate comprehensive report
- **Time**: 15-25 minutes

## Total Time

Varies based on iterations (30-120+ minutes)

## Iteration Planning

**How to Determine Number of Iterations:**

- **2 Iterations**: Clear topic, need overview then depth
- **3 Iterations**: Complex topic, multiple alternatives to compare
- **4+ Iterations**: Exploratory research, emerging field, significant unknowns

**Feedback Between Iterations:**

Each iteration informs the next:
- Iteration 1 findings → Focus areas for Iteration 2
- Iteration 2 depth → Comparison framework for Iteration 3
- Iteration 3 validation → Final synthesis and recommendations

## When to Use

- Exploring unfamiliar territory
- Progressive refinement needed
- Building on previous research
- Complex topics requiring phased approach
- Evolving understanding of research needs
- High uncertainty requiring staged investigation
