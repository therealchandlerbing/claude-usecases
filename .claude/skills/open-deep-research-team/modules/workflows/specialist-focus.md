# Specialist Focus Workflow

**Trigger**: User requests domain-specific research (e.g., "academic research on...", "technical analysis of...")

## Process

1. Brief generation focused on domain
2. Deploy primary specialist with supporting agents
3. Domain-specific synthesis
4. Specialized output format

## Total Time

20-35 minutes

## Specialist Combinations

### Academic Focus
**Primary**: Academic Researcher
**Supporting**: Data Analyst (for quantitative validation)
**Output**: Academic-style literature review

### Technical Focus
**Primary**: Technical Researcher
**Supporting**: Academic Researcher (for foundational research)
**Output**: Technical documentation with code examples

### Data/Statistical Focus
**Primary**: Data Analyst
**Supporting**: Academic Researcher (for methodology validation)
**Output**: Quantitative analysis with visualizations

## When to Use

- Domain-specific expertise required
- Technical evaluation needed
- Academic literature review
- Statistical analysis required
- Deep dive into single perspective needed
- User explicitly requests specific research type
