# Best Practices

## Query Formulation

### Effective Queries Include
- Specific topic or question
- Focus areas or subtopics
- Time frame (if relevant)
- Geographic scope (if relevant)
- Intended use or audience
- Output format preference

### Good Examples

"Research the current state of quantum computing for drug discovery, focusing on algorithmic approaches, real-world applications, and limitations. Include academic research from 2022-2024 and industry implementations."

"Compare the top 5 CI/CD platforms for enterprise use, analyzing features, pricing, scalability, and integration capabilities. Output as technical documentation."

### Queries to Refine
- "Tell me about AI" → Too broad, no focus
- "What's the best database?" → Lacks context
- "Research climate change" → Needs scope definition

## Maximizing Research Quality

### Do
- Provide context about why you need the research
- Specify preferred source types (academic, technical, industry)
- Indicate time sensitivity or recency requirements
- Request specific output format for your needs
- Ask for contradiction analysis when controversial
- Request confidence scores for critical findings

### Don't
- Rush complex research (quality takes time)
- Accept low-confidence findings for critical decisions
- Ignore acknowledged limitations
- Skip clarification when query is unclear
- Overlook contradictory evidence

## Working with Results

### Validate Critical Findings
- Check original sources when possible
- Look for recent updates or retractions
- Consider potential biases
- Seek additional expert review for high-stakes decisions

### Build on Research
- Save research reports for future reference
- Request iterative research for evolving topics
- Link related research projects
- Track how findings inform decisions

### Provide Feedback
- Note which findings were most valuable
- Identify any gaps or missing perspectives
- Share whether recommendations were actionable
- Help improve future research quality
