# Quality Assurance Framework

## Source Quality Standards

### Tier 1 (Highest Credibility)
- Peer-reviewed journals (Impact Factor > 5)
- Official government databases
- Primary research from reputable institutions
- Official technical documentation
- Regulatory filings

### Tier 2 (High Credibility)
- Peer-reviewed journals (Impact Factor 2-5)
- Preprint servers (arXiv, bioRxiv) with author credentials
- Well-maintained open-source projects (1000+ stars)
- Industry reports from established firms
- Conference proceedings from major conferences

### Tier 3 (Moderate Credibility)
- Technical blogs from recognized experts
- Industry publications
- Smaller peer-reviewed journals
- Active open-source projects (100+ stars)
- Reputable news sources

### Tier 4 (Use with Caution)
- General news articles
- Social media discussions (when citing public sentiment)
- Forum posts (when citing community practices)
- Blogs without clear authorship

### Do Not Use
- Unverified claims
- Anonymous sources without corroboration
- Known misinformation sources
- Promotional content without disclosure

## Confidence Scoring System

### Confidence Levels (0.0 - 1.0)

**0.9 - 1.0 (Very High Confidence)**
- Multiple Tier 1 sources in agreement
- Recent, well-cited research
- Empirically validated findings
- No significant contradictions

**0.7 - 0.89 (High Confidence)**
- Multiple Tier 1-2 sources in agreement
- Some contradictions but clear weight of evidence
- Established consensus in field
- Reasonable recency

**0.5 - 0.69 (Moderate Confidence)**
- Mix of source tiers
- Some contradictions present
- Emerging consensus
- Older sources or evolving field

**0.3 - 0.49 (Low Confidence)**
- Limited sources
- Significant contradictions
- Rapidly evolving field
- Mostly Tier 3-4 sources

**0.0 - 0.29 (Very Low Confidence)**
- Single source or very few sources
- Major contradictions
- Highly speculative
- Poor source quality

### How to Calculate Confidence Scores

1. Start with base score of 0.5
2. Add up to +0.3 for source quality (Tier 1 vs Tier 4)
3. Add up to +0.2 for source quantity (1 source vs 10+ sources)
4. Add up to +0.2 for source agreement (contradictions vs consensus)
5. Add up to +0.1 for recency (current vs outdated)
6. Subtract up to -0.3 for identified limitations or gaps
