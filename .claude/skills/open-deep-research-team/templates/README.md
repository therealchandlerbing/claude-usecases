## How to Use Templates

### Basic Usage
```
Use the [TEMPLATE NAME] template to research [SPECIFIC TOPIC]
```

**Example**:
```
Use the Academic Literature Review template to research graph neural networks
for molecular property prediction
```

### Customized Usage
```
Use the [TEMPLATE NAME] template with the following modifications:
- [Modification 1]
- [Modification 2]
```

**Example**:
```
Use the Market Research template with the following modifications:
- Focus on North America only
- Include 5-year projections instead of 3-year
- Add section on regulatory impacts
```

## Creating Custom Templates

Save a successful research configuration as a template for future use:

```
Save my current research configuration as template: "[CUSTOM TEMPLATE NAME]"
```

Future usage:
```
Use my "[CUSTOM TEMPLATE NAME]" template for [NEW TOPIC]
```

## Template Structure

Each template specifies:
- **Objective**: What this template achieves
- **Agent Configuration**: Which agents to deploy and their focus
- **Source Preferences**: Prioritized source types
- **Output Format**: Recommended report format
- **Estimated Time**: Typical completion time
- **Quality Criteria**: Success metrics

## Best Practices

1. **Choose the Right Template**: Match template to your research goal
2. **Customize as Needed**: Templates are starting points, not rigid rules
3. **Combine Templates**: Use multiple templates for complex research
4. **Save Successful Patterns**: Create custom templates from successful research
5. **Share Templates**: Team members can share effective templates

## Template Examples

### Example 1: Using Academic Literature Review Template

**Input**:
```
Use the Academic Literature Review template to research federated learning
for healthcare applications
```

**Automatic Configuration**:
- Primary Agent: Academic Researcher (40 minutes)
- Supporting Agents: Data Analyst (trend analysis), Technical Researcher (implementations)
- Source Focus: Peer-reviewed journals, preprints, conference proceedings
- Time Period: Last 5 years (with seminal papers from earlier)
- Output Format: Academic report with full bibliography
- Estimated Time: 65-80 minutes

### Example 2: Using Technology Evaluation Template

**Input**:
```
Use the Technology Evaluation template to compare Kubernetes, Docker Swarm,
and Nomad for microservices orchestration
```

**Automatic Configuration**:
- Primary Agent: Technical Researcher (35 minutes)
- Supporting Agents: Data Analyst (benchmarks), Academic Researcher (architecture patterns)
- Source Focus: GitHub repos, documentation, benchmark studies, production case studies
- Output Format: Technical documentation with comparison matrix
- Estimated Time: 55-70 minutes

## Combining Templates

For complex research needs, combine multiple templates:

**Example**:
```
Conduct research using:
1. Market Research template - to understand edge AI market
2. Technology Evaluation template - to compare edge AI frameworks
3. Competitive Intelligence template - to analyze key vendors

Synthesize into single comprehensive report on edge AI market and technology landscape
```
