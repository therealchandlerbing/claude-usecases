## 🎓 Best Practices

### Maximize Research Quality

**Do:**
- ✅ Provide specific research objectives
- ✅ Indicate preferred source types
- ✅ Specify time constraints upfront
- ✅ Request specific output format
- ✅ Ask for contradiction analysis
- ✅ Include relevant context

**Don't:**
- ❌ Rush complex research
- ❌ Accept low confidence for critical decisions
- ❌ Ignore acknowledged limitations
- ❌ Skip clarification when unclear
- ❌ Overlook contradictory evidence

### Effective Query Patterns

**Strong Queries Include:**
1. Specific topic or question
2. Focus areas or subtopics
3. Time frame (if relevant)
4. Geographic scope (if relevant)
5. Intended use or audience
6. Output format preference

**Example**:
```
Research the current state of autonomous vehicle technology, focusing on:
- Sensor fusion techniques (academic research 2022-2024)
- Regulatory challenges in US and EU
- Market projections 2024-2030
- Key players and their approaches
- Output as executive presentation for board
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Research is taking longer than expected"
**Solution**: Switch to Express mode for quick results, then deep dive on priority areas

### "Too many contradictions in findings"
**Solution**: This is valuable! Use contradiction analysis to understand different perspectives

### "Need more technical depth"
**Solution**: Request Specialist Focus mode with Technical Researcher as primary agent

### "Output is too academic for my audience"
**Solution**: Specify Business Report format with executive summary emphasis

### "Insufficient recent sources"
**Solution**: Expand time window and include preprint servers, technical blogs
