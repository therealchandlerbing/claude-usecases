- [ ] Resource requirements noted (if applicable)
- [ ] Risk assessment included

### Limitations & Gaps
- [ ] Research limitations explicitly stated
- [ ] Data gaps identified
- [ ] Methodological constraints noted
- [ ] Source access issues mentioned (paywalls, etc.)
- [ ] Time constraints acknowledged (if applicable)
- [ ] Areas needing further research identified

### Accessibility
- [ ] Technical jargon defined
- [ ] Appropriate for intended audience

- [ ] Examples provided for complex concepts

---

## Post-Delivery Phase

### Quality Metrics Review

## Common Quality Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Low Confidence Scores
**Symptoms**: Most findings <0.6 confidence
**Causes**:
- Insufficient sources
- Low-quality sources
- Contradictory findings without resolution
**Solutions**:
- Expand source search
- Prioritize higher-tier sources
- Deeper contradiction analysis
- Acknowledge uncertainty explicitly

### Issue: Incomplete Coverage
**Symptoms**: Research questions partially answered
**Causes**:
- Scope too broad for time available
- Sources unavailable
- Topic too novel (limited research exists)
**Solutions**:
- Narrow scope
- Extend research time
- Accept limitations and document gaps
- Use expert interviews (if available)

### Issue: Citation Gaps
**Symptoms**: Findings without proper citations
**Causes**:
- Lost track of sources during research
- Synthesis created new claims without source attribution
**Solutions**:
- Track citations during research, not after
- Ensure every finding has source trail
- Cross-check final report against source list

### Issue: Oversimplified Synthesis
**Symptoms**: Nuanced findings reduced to simple claims
**Causes**:
- Pressure for concise output
- Difficulty integrating contradictions
**Solutions**:
- Preserve nuance in detailed sections
- Use executive summary for simplification
- Explicitly note when simplifying
- Include contradictions section

## Continuous Improvement

After each research project:
1. Review this checklist
2. Identify any missed items
3. Analyze root causes of quality gaps
4. Adjust research process for next project
5. Update checklist if new quality dimensions discovered

---

## Remember

Quality is non-negotiable. Better to:
- Acknowledge limitations honestly
- Take more time for thoroughness
- Admit when confidence is low
- Note gaps in knowledge

Than to:
- Overstate confidence
- Rush and miss critical sources
- Oversimplify contradictions
- Claim certainty where none exists
