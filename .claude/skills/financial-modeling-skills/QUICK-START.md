## Troubleshooting

**"Which sub-skill do I need?"**
→ See decision tree above
→ Investment = use Investment Analysis
→ Portfolio = use Portfolio Intelligence
→ Impact = use Impact Modeling

**"Can I combine multiple sub-skills?"**
→ Yes! For impact investments: Investment Analysis + Impact Modeling
→ System automatically integrates outputs

**"Data not available?"**
→ System will use web search as fallback
→ Clearly documents data sources and confidence levels
→ Flags low-confidence data for verification

**"Model too complex?"**
→ Request simplified version: "Create simplified model for internal review"
→ Or focus on specific areas: "Just need returns analysis and sensitivity"

**"Need different format?"**
→ Specify: "Deliver as PowerPoint instead of Excel"
→ Or: "Create HTML dashboard instead of Excel"
