# Motion Preparation Workflow
## Specialized Reference for Board Packet Motion Tracking

This file is loaded just-in-time when generating the Motion Tracking Sheet component of the board packet.

---

## Purpose

Pre-draft all motions that will come before the board for vote, formatted for real-time recording during the meeting. Motions must be specific, actionable, and aligned with the agenda. The motion tracking sheet becomes the formal record of board decisions.

---

## Motion Fundamentals

### What Makes a Good Motion

**Specific**: Clearly defines what action is being authorized
**Actionable**: Can be executed by identified parties
**Complete**: Includes all necessary terms, conditions, and parameters
**Unambiguous**: No room for multiple interpretations
**Timed**: Includes timeline or effective date where relevant

### Motion Structure

**Standard Format**:
"I move that [subject] [action verb] [object], [including specific terms, conditions, and parameters]."

**Examples**:

✅ Good: "I move that we approve the 2026 operating budget of $45,000 with revenue targets of $40,000 from operations and $5,000 from grants."

❌ Too Vague: "I move that we approve the budget."

✅ Good: "I move that Chandler Lewis be elected as Board Chair of 360 Social Impact Studios for a term of one year, effective immediately."

❌ Incomplete: "I move that Chandler be Chair."

## Motion Drafting Logic

### Step 1: Review Agenda

For each agenda item, determine if it requires board action:

**Requires Motion** (decision or authorization needed):
- Officer elections
- Budget approval
- Strategic plan adoption
- Major partnerships/contracts
- Significant expenditures
- Policy changes
- Meeting calendar

**No Motion Needed** (informational or discussion only):
- Status updates
- Financial dashboard review (unless specific action required)
- Discussion items without decision point

### Step 2: Draft Motion Text

For each item requiring action:

1. Identify the subject (what is being acted upon)
2. Choose action verb (approve, adopt, authorize, elect, confirm, etc.)
3. Include all necessary specifics (amounts, dates, terms, parties, conditions)
4. Add authorization of signing authority if needed
5. Include effective date or timeline

### Step 3: Sequence Motions

Order motions logically:

1. Approve agenda (first)
2. Board confirmation (if annual meeting)
3. Officer elections (if annual meeting)
4. Banking resolution (if annual meeting or change)
5. Strategic priorities
6. Major partnerships/initiatives
7. Budget/financial authorizations
8. Governance items (calendar, policies, etc.)
9. Program launches/changes
10. Ad hoc items from discussion
11. Adjournment (last)

### Step 4: Number Motions

Number sequentially starting from 1, even if some motions are conditional or may not be presented.

Leave space for 2-3 ad hoc motions that may arise during the meeting.

---

## Motion Tracking Sheet Format

For each motion, create table entry:

```
MOTION [#]: [Concise Title]

"[Full motion text in quotes]"

Moved by: ______________

Seconded by: ______________

Vote: ☐ Approved ☐ Denied ☐ Abstained

[If voice vote: List of votes]
[If roll call: Individual votes by member]
```

---

## Special Cases

### Conditional Motions

If a motion depends on another motion passing, note this:

"MOTION 8: SpacePlan JV Budget Allocation *(Conditional on Motion 7 approval)*"

### Amended Motions

Leave space for amendments:

"[Original motion text]

**Amendment**: [If amended during meeting, record amendment here]

**Final Motion as Amended**: [Revised text]"

### Tabled Motions

If motion is tabled for future meeting:

"MOTION [#]: [Title]

**Status**: Tabled until [date] to allow for [reason]"

### Failed Motions

Record even if motion fails:

"Vote: ☐ Approved ☒ Denied ☐ Abstained

**Notes**: Motion failed [vote count]. Board directed [alternative action if any]."
