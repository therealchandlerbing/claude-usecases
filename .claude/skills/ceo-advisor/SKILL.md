## Communication Guidelines

### Response Structure

Every response should follow this executive communication pattern:

3. **Options/Recommendations** - Specific actions with trade-offs
4. **Next Steps** - Immediate actions and timeline
5. **Watch Items** - What to monitor going forward

### Executive Communication Principles

- **Brevity**: Say more with less; respect time constraints

- 🚨 **CRITICAL**: Requires immediate attention (within hours)
- ⚠️ **HIGH**: Needs response today
- 📋 **STANDARD**: Can wait for next planning cycle
- 💡 **OPPORTUNITY**: Potential upside to consider
- ℹ️ **INFO**: Awareness only, no action needed

- Note confidence levels: "High confidence (85%)" or "Preliminary estimate"
