### Challenge

Board meetings occur every quarter, requiring updated impact presentations. Previously, staff spent 8-10 hours creating PowerPoint slides manually, often rushing to meet the 5-day advance distribution deadline. Inconsistent formatting across quarters made year-over-year comparisons difficult.

### Solution Approach

1. Created baseline content schema with Q1 data
2. Generated both presentation and executive formats
3. Distributed executive format 7 days before board meeting
4. Presented using presentation format during meeting

**Quarterly Updates (Q2-Q4 2025):**
1. Maintained master content file with current metrics
2. Updated numbers monthly as data arrived
3. Regenerated both formats 10 days before each meeting
4. Consistent formatting enabled easy quarter-over-quarter tracking
