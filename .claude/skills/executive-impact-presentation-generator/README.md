# Executive Impact Presentation Generator

**Generate board-ready impact reports in dual formats from a single content input—professional, accessible, and print-perfect.**

---

## Why This Skill Exists

Boards, funders, and stakeholders demand professional impact reporting. But creating polished presentations is time-consuming, and maintaining consistency across formats is challenging.

**This skill solves that.**

One content input. Two professional formats. Minutes, not hours.

---

## The Dual-Format Advantage

### Presentation Format
**Fixed-slide deck for live board meetings**

- Landscape slides optimized for presentations
- One slide per section (7 slides total: cover + 6 sections)
- Perfect for meetings, board displays, PowerPoint alternatives
- Slide-based navigation (arrows, dots, keyboard)
- Prints as landscape PDF deck (one slide per page)

### Executive Format
**Continuous document for comprehensive review**

- Portrait layout for detailed reading
- Sections flow naturally with unlimited height
- Perfect for email distribution, stakeholder sharing
- Section-based navigation with smooth scrolling
- Prints as portrait PDF document (multi-page)

**Same content. Optimized for different contexts. Generated simultaneously.**

## What You Get

### Six Comprehensive Sections

Every impact report includes:

1. **Impact Overview** - Top-line metrics and momentum highlights
2. **Regional Portfolio** - Geographic allocation and strategic priorities
3. **Financial Performance** - Capital structure, mix, and safeguards
4. **Program Outcomes** - Three impact pillars with detailed metrics
5. **Partnership Ecosystem** - Collaboration statistics and flagship partnerships
6. **Strategic Outlook** - Three-horizon roadmap and leadership asks

### Professional Polish

- **Brand Customization**: Your color, your organization name, consistent identity
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant with keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Print Perfect**: Optimized PDF export for both landscape (deck) and portrait (document)
- **Responsive Design**: Works beautifully on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Fast & Offline**: < 1 second load, works fully offline after initial load
- **Self-Contained**: No external dependencies except Google Fonts

### Quality Assurance

Every report validated for:
- Content completeness (all sections present)
- Technical accuracy (valid HTML5, functional navigation)
- Visual consistency (typography, spacing, brand application)
- Accessibility compliance (keyboard, screen reader, contrast)
- Print quality (correct orientation, backgrounds, page breaks)

---

## How It Works

### 1. Provide Your Content

Share your organizational impact data in any format:
- Structured (JSON, YAML, spreadsheet)
- Semi-structured (bullet points, descriptions)
- Natural language (conversational)
- Previous report update (delta changes)

**Minimum required:**
- Organization name and brand color (hex code)
- Metrics and descriptions for all six sections

### 2. Skill Generates Both Formats

The skill:
1. Parses your content into standard schema
2. Applies your branding (color, organization name)
3. Populates both template formats
4. Validates completeness and quality
5. Generates two ready-to-use HTML files

### 3. Download and Distribute

Receive two files:
- `[Organization]-Impact-Report-Presentation-[Year].html`
- `[Organization]-Impact-Report-Executive-[Year].html`

**Open in Chrome and export to PDF:**
- Presentation: Landscape orientation (one slide per page)
- Executive: Portrait orientation (multi-page document)

**Distribute:**
- Email executive format to stakeholders
- Present using presentation format in board meetings
- Archive both PDFs for organizational records

**Time from content to delivery: 10-20 minutes**

## Format Selection Guide

| Need | Choose This Format |
|------|-------------------|
| Live board presentation | **Presentation** (landscape slides) |
| Email to stakeholders | **Executive** (portrait document) |
| PDF slide deck | **Presentation** (one slide per page) |
| Comprehensive review document | **Executive** (multi-page flow) |
| Meeting facilitator display | **Presentation** (slide navigation) |
| Detailed reading and reference | **Executive** (continuous scroll) |

## What Makes This Skill Special

### 1. Dual-Format Innovation

Most tools force you to choose: presentation OR document. This skill generates both simultaneously from one content source, optimized for their specific contexts.

### 2. Board-Ready Polish

Not a draft. Not a template with placeholders. **Production-quality outputs** suitable for board meetings, funder reports, and stakeholder communications without additional editing.

### 3. Accessibility First

WCAG 2.1 AA compliant from the start:
- Keyboard navigation (arrows, tab, enter, space, home, end)
- Screen reader support (semantic HTML, ARIA labels)
- Color contrast validated (4.5:1 ratio)
- Focus indicators and reduced motion support

### 4. Print Perfection

Unlike web-only tools, these reports print beautifully:
- Presentation: Perfect landscape deck (one slide per page)
- Executive: Clean portrait document (logical page breaks)
- Background graphics, colors, and design preserved
- Chrome print = perfect PDF every time

### 5. Speed and Simplicity

From content to delivery in 10-20 minutes. No design skills required. No complex software. Just Claude and your organizational data.
