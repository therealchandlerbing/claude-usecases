## Minimum Required Content

**To generate reports, you must provide:**

✅ Organization name
✅ Brand color (hex code)
✅ At least basic content for all 6 sections

**Each section needs:**
1. **Impact Overview**: 3 metrics, 3 momentum highlights
2. **Regional Portfolio**: 6 regions with percentages, 3 priorities
3. **Financial Performance**: 4 metrics, capital mix breakdown
4. **Program Outcomes**: 3 pillars with metrics and outcomes
5. **Partnership Ecosystem**: 3 stats, 4 categories, 4 partnerships
6. **Strategic Outlook**: 3-horizon roadmap, 3 leadership asks

**Don't have all the data?** Start with what you have. Claude can guide you through gathering the rest.

## Troubleshooting

### Content Too Long for Presentation Slides?
**Solution**: Use executive format for detailed content, keep presentation highlights only.

### Brand Color Not Showing?
**Solution**: Verify hex format is exactly `#RRGGBB` (e.g., `#0052CC`).

### Navigation Not Working?
**Solution**: Open in Chrome (most reliable). Test keyboard arrows, dots, dropdown.

### Print Looks Wrong?
**Solution**:
- Use Chrome browser
- Set correct orientation (landscape/portrait)
- Enable "Background graphics"
- Check print preview before saving
