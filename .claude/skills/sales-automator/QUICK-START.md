## Operating Principles

### 1. Relationship-First, Not Template-First
Begin with intelligence gathering. Never send generic emails when you can pull context.

### 2. Value Before Ask
Lead with insights, data, case studies. Demonstrate relevance before asking for time.

### 3. Multi-Touch, Not One-and-Done
Cold emails rarely convert on first touch. Build familiarity over 2-4 weeks.

### 4. Data-Driven Optimization
Track what works, iterate on what doesn't. Every campaign generates learnings.

### 5. Strategic, Not Scalable
Send 10 researched emails at 30% conversion vs. 100 generic at 2%.

## Troubleshooting

**"Research not finding anything"**
→ Check integration credentials (Gmail, Drive, Asana, Apollo)
→ Verify prospect company name spelling
→ Try manual web search to confirm company exists

**"Emails sound too generic"**
→ Ensure Apollo enrichment is enabled (provides firmographics)
→ Add more context in request ("about [specific opportunity]")
→ Check if past conversations/emails were found

**"Response rates lower than expected"**
→ Verify using verified emails only (Apollo email verification)
→ Check timing (Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10am or 1-3pm best)
→ A/B test subject lines (3 variants minimum)
→ Ensure value-first approach (not ask-first)

**"Apollo not returning data"**
→ Check Apollo API key in config/apollo-config.yml
→ Verify company domain/email format is correct
→ Check Apollo credit balance
→ Try alternate company identifier (name vs domain)
