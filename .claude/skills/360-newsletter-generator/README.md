# 360 Newsletter Generator

**Transform Organizational Data into Executive Intelligence**

Automatically generate sophisticated, publication-quality newsletters and executive briefs by synthesizing data from Asana, Gmail, and Google Drive into professionally designed interactive dashboards.

---

## The Problem

Leadership teams spend hours each week manually compiling updates from multiple sources:
- Scattered project updates across Asana
- Important communications buried in email
- Strategic documents distributed across Drive
- No consistent format for stakeholder communication
- Tribal knowledge about what matters most

Result: Incomplete briefings, missed insights, and wasted executive time.

## The Solution

The 360 Newsletter Generator automatically:
- **Collects data** from Asana projects, Gmail threads, and Google Drive documents
- **Analyzes significance** using a 0-100 scoring algorithm
- **Prioritizes content** to lead with what matters most
- **Generates professional HTML** with interactive charts and navigation
- **Maintains consistency** with standardized sections and formatting

**Time saved: 2-3 hours per week** on manual compilation

## Two Output Formats

### 1. Executive Brief (Confidential)

For leadership, board members, and investors.

Includes:
- Financial data and projections
- HR updates and compensation details
- Strategic risk assessments
- Investment information
- Board governance items

### 2. General Newsletter (Stakeholder)

For partners, team members, and external stakeholders.

Includes:
- High-level progress updates
- Impact stories and outcomes

**Both use the same professional dashboard design** with interactive charts, collapsible sections, and print-friendly formatting.
