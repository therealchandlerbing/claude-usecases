# Design Director

**Transform functional outputs into professionally polished, design-elevated work**

## Overview

The Design Director is a comprehensive design elevation skill that transforms generic visual outputs (presentations, dashboards, HTML interfaces, reports) from "works correctly" to "professionally designed." It applies systematic design thinking, references world-class exemplars (Stripe, Linear, Apple), and ensures every output looks hand-crafted rather than template-based.

## Key Capabilities

- **Systematic Design Elevation**: 6-phase protocol from functional foundation to polished delivery
- **Exemplar-Based Design**: References Stripe, Linear, Apple, Bauhaus, Swiss Design
- **40+ Specific Techniques**: Typography, color, layout, visual elements, data visualization
- **Multiple Output Types**: Presentations, spreadsheets, HTML/web, reports, dashboards
- **Quality Validation**: Built-in checks ensure professional, portfolio-worthy results

## When to Use

### Trigger Patterns

This skill activates when encountering:
- "elevate" or "polish" visual outputs
- "make this look professional"
- "design best practices"
- Requests for presentations, dashboards, HTML pages
- "match Stripe/Linear/Apple"
- Any visual output where quality matters

### Automatic Activation

The skill should activate automatically when creating:
- Executive presentations
- Client-facing materials
- Data dashboards
- Web interfaces
- Reports with visual elements

### Perfect For

- C-suite and board presentations
- Client deliverables
- Portfolio-worthy outputs
- Data-heavy dashboards
- Modern web interfaces

### Not Designed For

- Quick internal drafts where design doesn't matter
- Technical documentation without visual elements
- When user explicitly wants minimal/no styling

## Quick Example

**Before Design Director:**
```
Generic dashboard with default Excel colors, Arial font,
cramped spacing, basic borders, no visual hierarchy
```

**After Design Director:**
```
Stripe-inspired dashboard with:
- #0A2540 deep blue palette
- Inter typography with clear hierarchy (24px headlines, 14px body)
- 8-point grid spacing system
- Subtle shadows for card elevation
- Clean tables with minimal borders
- Information hierarchy that guides the eye
```

## Core Philosophy

**Professional, Not Precious**: Design serves content, not the other way around

**Confidence Through Restraint**: 2-3 deliberate techniques beat 10 mediocre ones

**Context-Appropriate Excellence**: Match design intensity to audience and purpose

**Specific Over Generic**: "Stripe's #0A2540" not "professional blue"

**Borrowed Excellence**: Reference the best, adapt for context

**Hand-Crafted Appearance**: Intentional choices, never default

## The 6-Phase Elevation Protocol

1. **Functional Foundation** - Verify content works correctly
2. **Design Interrogation** - Question every design choice systematically
3. **Technique Selection** - Choose 2-3 high-impact techniques
4. **Systematic Application** - Apply consistently throughout
5. **Quality Validation** - Verify against professional standards
6. **Delivery Preparation** - Present appropriately

## Design Exemplars

**Stripe** - Financial interfaces, dashboards, trust-focused
**Linear** - Product tools, modern SaaS, efficiency
**Apple** - Consumer-facing, elegant, minimal
**Notion** - Content-first, collaborative
**Bauhaus** - Geometric, bold, systematic
**Swiss Design** - Grid-based, typography-focused

Claude automatically selects the right exemplar based on:
- Purpose (persuade, inform, analyze)
- Audience (technical, executive, consumer)
- Information density
- Medium (presentation, report, web)

## What You Get

### Before This Skill
- Generic templates
- Default colors and fonts
- Obvious AI origin
- Functional but mediocre

### After This Skill
- Specific design references
- Deliberate palettes and typography
- Hand-crafted appearance
- Professional, portfolio-ready quality

## Real-World Use Cases

### Sales Dashboard
**Transformation**: Default Excel → Stripe-inspired clarity
**Techniques**: Blue palette (#0A2540), 8pt grid, Inter typography
**Result**: Trust-focused, data-clear professional dashboard

### Executive Presentation
**Transformation**: Generic slides → Apple-inspired elegance
**Techniques**: Large typography (3x scale), restrained color, generous margins
**Result**: Board-ready presentation that commands attention

### Web Interface
**Transformation**: Bootstrap defaults → Linear-inspired modern
**Techniques**: Purple-blue palette (#5E6AD2), 4pt grid, interaction states
**Result**: Contemporary, efficiency-focused interface

### Financial Report
**Transformation**: Dense Arial text → Swiss Design systematic
**Techniques**: Georgia + Inter pairing, mathematical grid, clear hierarchy
**Result**: Professional credibility with optimal readability

## Getting Started

1. **Quick Start**: Read `QUICK-START.md` for 5-minute onboarding
2. **Start Using**: Just ask for visual outputs - skill activates automatically
3. **Iterate**: Request changes naturally ("make colors bolder", "more white space")
4. **Learn**: Ask "explain design choices" to understand the thinking

## Success Indicators

You'll know the skill is working when:
- Colleagues ask "Did you hire a designer?"
- Visual outputs feel distinctly more professional
- You stop tweaking formatting manually
- Presentations command more attention
- Design quality matches content quality

## Model & Tools

- **Model**: Default (inherits from parent)
- **Tools**: Read, Write

## Integration

Works well with:
- **Skill Orchestrator**: For complex multi-skill workflows
- **Executive Impact Presentation Generator**: Design elevation for reports
- **360 Client Portfolio Builder**: Ensure portfolio pages meet standards
- **CEO Advisor**: Elevate advisory deliverables

## Support & Troubleshooting

**Output not elevated enough?**
→ Ask: "Apply comprehensive design elevation"

**Output too fancy?**
→ Say: "Simplify this design" or "Apply restraint principles"

**Want specific style?**
→ Mention: "Reference Stripe/Linear/Apple approach"

**Need to understand choices?**
→ Ask: "Explain your design decisions"
