# Design Interrogation Checklist

**Part 2 of 5 - Design Director Reference Documentation**

Use this checklist internally before delivering any visual output. These questions ensure every design choice is intentional.

## Typography

**Primary questions:**
- [ ] Is the font choice deliberate, or am I using a default?
- [ ] Do I have at least two sizes creating hierarchy? (not just bold vs. regular)
- [ ] Is line height appropriate for reading comfort? (generally 1.5x-1.7x font size)
- [ ] Is letter spacing intentional? (negative for headlines, slightly positive for small text)
- [ ] Do headings and body text have a meaningful relationship? (not just "bigger")

**Specific checks:**
- [ ] If using system fonts, did I choose Inter, SF Pro, Segoe UI deliberately? (not just Arial)
- [ ] If using web fonts, are they loading correctly and performant?
- [ ] Is all-caps used sparingly and with increased letter-spacing?
- [ ] Are font weights used to create hierarchy? (not just size)
- [ ] Is there a typographic rhythm? (consistent spacing relationships)

## Color

**Primary questions:**
- [ ] Am I using 2-3 colors maximum, or did I grab a rainbow?
- [ ] Can I name what each color achieves? (hierarchy, categorization, emphasis)
- [ ] Are these colors chosen from references (Stripe, Linear, etc.) or generic defaults?
- [ ] Does color contrast meet accessibility standards? (4.5:1 minimum for text)
- [ ] Am I using color to convey meaning that works without color? (not relying only on color)

**Specific checks:**
- [ ] Primary color: Is it distinctive and appropriate to context?
- [ ] Secondary/accent: Does it complement without competing?
- [ ] Neutrals: Am I using true grays or slightly tinted grays? (tinted is often better)
- [ ] Background: Is there subtle contrast or just flat white?
- [ ] Text: Are grays used for hierarchy? (not just black for everything)

## Layout & Spacing

**Primary questions:**
- [ ] Is white space deliberate, or am I using default padding?
- [ ] Do elements align to a grid, or are they randomly placed?
- [ ] Is there breathing room around important elements?
- [ ] Are spacing relationships consistent? (same gap between similar elements)
- [ ] Does the layout guide the eye through a clear path?

**Specific checks:**
- [ ] Margins: Are they generous and intentional? (not cramped)
- [ ] Padding: Does it create clear boundaries and hierarchy?
- [ ] Alignment: Do elements relate to each other spatially?
- [ ] Negative space: Am I using emptiness to create emphasis?
- [ ] Density: Is information appropriately spaced for the medium?

## Hierarchy & Structure

**Primary questions:**
- [ ] Can I identify the visual hierarchy in 3 levels? (primary, secondary, tertiary)
- [ ] Does the most important information stand out immediately?
- [ ] Are similar elements treated consistently?
- [ ] Do headings create clear sectioning?
- [ ] Is there too much competing for attention?

**Specific checks:**
- [ ] Headlines: Are they distinctive enough from body text?
- [ ] Subheadings: Do they bridge headline and body effectively?
- [ ] Body text: Is it comfortable to read for the length required?
- [ ] Emphasis: Am I using bold/italic/color strategically? (not everywhere)
- [ ] Structure: Can a reader scan and understand organization quickly?

## Visual Elements

**Primary questions:**
- [ ] Does every visual element serve a purpose?
- [ ] Are decorative elements minimal and tasteful?
- [ ] Do borders/lines/dividers add clarity or clutter?
- [ ] Are shadows/depth effects subtle and purposeful?
- [ ] Do icons/images enhance understanding?

**Specific checks:**
- [ ] Borders: Only where they create meaningful separation?
- [ ] Shadows: Subtle and consistent throughout?
- [ ] Dividers: Used sparingly to separate distinct sections?
- [ ] Icons: Consistent style and appropriate sizing?
- [ ] Images: High quality and purposefully placed?

## Data Visualization (if applicable)

**Primary questions:**
- [ ] Is the chart type appropriate for the data?
- [ ] Are colors used meaningfully? (not default Excel palette)
- [ ] Can labels be read easily?
- [ ] Is there appropriate context (titles, axes, legends)?
- [ ] Would Stripe or Linear present data this way?

**Specific checks:**
- [ ] Chart colors: Accessible and distinctive?
- [ ] Axis labels: Clear and appropriately sized?
- [ ] Data labels: Present where helpful, absent where cluttered?
- [ ] Legend: Positioned logically and easy to reference?
- [ ] Grid lines: Subtle helpers, not visual noise?

## Context-Specific

**For presentations:**
- [ ] Is text large enough for rear of room? (minimum 24pt for body)
- [ ] Is contrast high enough for projection?
- [ ] Are slides visually distinct from each other?
- [ ] Is there a clear visual rhythm through the deck?

**For spreadsheets:**
- [ ] Are headers clearly distinguished from data?
- [ ] Is color used to categorize or emphasize?
- [ ] Are important cells/ranges visually prioritized?
- [ ] Is the sheet scannable and organized logically?

**For web/HTML:**
- [ ] Do interaction states exist? (hover, active, focus)
- [ ] Is the design responsive to different sizes?
- [ ] Are touch targets appropriately sized? (minimum 44x44px)
- [ ] Is loading/performance considered in design choices?

**For reports/documents:**
- [ ] Is typography optimized for extended reading?
- [ ] Are pages visually consistent throughout?
- [ ] Is there appropriate page structure (headers, footers, margins)?
- [ ] Are section breaks clear and helpful?

## Final Quality Check

Before delivering, confirm:
- [ ] Does this look hand-crafted, not template-based?
- [ ] Would I show this in a design portfolio?
- [ ] Are there 2-3 signature choices that elevate this?
- [ ] Did I reference exemplars (Stripe, Linear, Apple, etc.)?
- [ ] Is every choice intentional and defensible?
- [ ] Have I removed anything unnecessary?
- [ ] Does this achieve the right balance of boldness and restraint?

## Red Flags (if any are true, revise)

- Using defaults without consideration
- More than 4 colors in the palette
- No clear visual hierarchy
- Typography is all one size/weight
- White space feels cramped or accidental
- Looks like it could be from 2010
- Generic "professional" aesthetic
- Every element competing for attention
- Could swap this with a template and no one would notice
