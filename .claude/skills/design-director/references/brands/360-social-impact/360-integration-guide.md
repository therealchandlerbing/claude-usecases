# 360 Brand Integration Guide

**How to Apply 360 Branding with Design Director**

---

## Overview

This guide explains how the Design Director skill integrates 360 Social Impact Studios branding into its elevation workflow. When creating materials for 360, the Design Director's systematic approach combines with 360's specific brand requirements.

**Key Principle:** Design Director provides the *how* (elevation techniques, quality standards), while 360 branding provides the *what* (specific colors, logos, typography).

---

## When to Activate 360 Branding

### Automatic Triggers

360 branding should activate when:

- User request mentions "360 Social Impact Studios" or "360"
- Document is for 360 partners, board, community, or internal use
- User explicitly requests "360 branding" or "360 brand standards"
- Creating materials for Chandler Lewis or 360 team

### Manual Activation

User can explicitly invoke:
```
"Using 360 branding standards, create..."
"Apply Design Director with 360 brand to..."
"Elevate this with 360's visual identity..."
```

## Modified 6-Phase Elevation Protocol

The Design Director's 6-phase protocol adapts for 360 branding:

### Phase 1: Functional Foundation

**Standard Process:** Get content working correctly

**360 Additions:**

### Phase 2: Design Interrogation

**Standard Process:** Question every design choice

**360 Integration:**

- **PLUS:** Check against 360 brand requirements

**360-Specific Questions:**

**Branding:**
- Is 360 logo present? Correct variation? Proper size and placement?
- Does logo have adequate clear space?

**Color:**
- Am I using 360's exact hex codes (Navy #1E4D6B, Bright Blue #00A7E1)?
- Is color palette appropriate for audience?
  - Partners/Board: Navy + Bright Blue + White?
  - Community: Vibrant accent colors?
  - Brazil: Warm palette (Orange + Magenta)?
- No yellow text on white backgrounds?

**Typography:**

2. Don't rely on color names ("blue") - use hex (#1E4D6B)
3. For CSS/code, copy color values from Quick Reference
4. For presentations/documents, set custom colors with hex codes
5. Validate against [360 Brand Standards](360-brand-standards.md)

---

### Wrong Audience Palette Applied

---

### Accessibility Failure

   - Bright Blue (#00A7E1) on white ✓
   - Magenta (#E6007E) on white ✓
   - Lime Green (#7AC143) on white ✓
3. Increase font size if needed (min 10pt body, 8pt captions)
4. Test with contrast checker
5. Add icons/labels, not just color

---

### Fonts Not Available

**Problem:** Montserrat or Open Sans not available in environment

**Solution:**
1. Use fallback: Arial for both headings and body
