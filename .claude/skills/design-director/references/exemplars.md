- Exceptions rare and justified

### Linear's approach

- Tighter control for dense interfaces
- More granular spacing options

### Apple's approach

- Scale: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80px
- Generous default spacing
- Scales up for marketing

## Practical Application

### Choosing an exemplar

Ask these questions:
1. **What's the primary purpose?** (sell, inform, analyze, create)
2. **Who's the audience?** (technical, executive, consumer)
3. **What's the information density?** (high, medium, low)
4. **What's the emotional tone?** (trust, excitement, calm, power)

### Matching purpose to exemplar

**High trust, technical audience, data-heavy:**
→ Reference Stripe

**Product workflow, efficiency-focused:**
→ Reference Linear

**Consumer-facing, elegant, simple:**
→ Reference Apple

**Content-heavy, collaborative:**
→ Reference Notion

**Systematic, professional, institutional:**
→ Reference Swiss Design

**Bold, modern, geometric:**
→ Reference Bauhaus

### Combining exemplars

You can blend approaches:
- Stripe's color restraint + Linear's spacing system
- Apple's typography + Stripe's data visualization
- Swiss Design's grid + Linear's interface patterns

But never:
- Mix more than 2-3 references per design
- Combine conflicting philosophies (minimalist + maximalist)
- Reference without understanding why

### Adapting not copying

**Good adaptation:**
- Uses Stripe's blue palette (#0A2540) but adapted to brand
- References Linear's spacing (4px base) but adjusted for medium
- Borrows Apple's typography scale but uses different fonts

**Bad copying:**
- Exact Stripe dashboard replica
- Pixel-perfect Linear interface clone
- Unchanged Apple landing page

The goal is to understand what makes these exemplars excellent, then apply those principles to your specific context.
