# Elevation Protocol

**Part 5 of 5 - Design Director Reference Documentation**

Systematic process for refining visual outputs from functional to professionally polished. Follow this sequence for every design.

## Phase 1: Functional Foundation

**Goal:** Get content working correctly before any aesthetic refinement.

### Step 1: Content Structure
- Ensure all requested information is present
- Verify data accuracy and completeness
- Establish logical content hierarchy
- Confirm functionality (formulas, interactions, etc.)

### Step 2: Basic Organization
- Apply minimal structure (headings, sections, tables)
- Ensure readability (no overlapping elements, readable text size)
- Verify technical requirements (responsive, functional, etc.)
- Test that core purpose is achieved

**Quality gate:** Could someone use this effectively, even if it's not beautiful?
- If no: Fix functional issues before proceeding
- If yes: Continue to Phase 2

## Phase 2: Design Interrogation

**Goal:** Question every design choice systematically.

### Step 1: Reference the Interrogation Checklist
Read `interrogation-checklist.md` and evaluate the functional foundation against all criteria:
- Typography
- Color
- Layout & spacing
- Hierarchy & structure
- Visual elements
- Context-specific considerations

### Step 2: Identify Weak Points
Document what fails interrogation:
- Generic fonts or default sizing
- Lack of color strategy
- Inconsistent spacing
- Unclear hierarchy
- Missing visual refinement
- Template-like appearance

### Step 3: Choose Target Exemplar
Read `exemplars.md` and select 1-2 exemplars based on:
- Purpose (dashboard, presentation, report, etc.)
- Audience (technical, executive, consumer)
- Information density (high, medium, low)
- Desired perception (trust, modern, elegant, etc.)

**Quality gate:** Can you articulate specific design weaknesses and chosen exemplar?
- If no: Spend more time interrogating
- If yes: Continue to Phase 3

## Phase 3: Technique Selection

**Goal:** Choose 2-3 specific techniques to elevate the design.

### Step 1: Review Technique Catalog
Read `technique-catalog.md` focusing on sections relevant to:
- Identified weak points from interrogation
- Chosen exemplar(s)
- Output type (presentation, spreadsheet, HTML, etc.)

### Step 2: Select Primary Techniques
Choose 2-3 techniques that will have maximum impact:

**For typography-focused elevation:**
- Typography scale (modular, specific sizes)
- Weight relationships (hierarchy through weight)
- Letter spacing (headlines tighter, all-caps looser)

**For color-focused elevation:**
- Palette from exemplar (Stripe blues, Linear purples, etc.)
- Strategic color application (semantic, emphasis, hierarchy)
- Background sophistication (subtle tints, gradients)

**For layout-focused elevation:**
- Grid system (8-point, 12-column, etc.)
- Spacing scale (consistent rhythm)
- White space strategy (generous, deliberate)

**For hierarchy-focused elevation:**
- Size relationships (2.5x headlines, not 1.5x)
- Visual weight (multiple techniques combined)
- Grouping through proximity (space shows relationships)

### Step 3: Validate Technique Compatibility
Ensure chosen techniques:
- Work together, not against each other
- Align with chosen exemplar
- Are appropriate for output type
- Can be applied consistently throughout

**Quality gate:** Do you have 2-3 specific, named techniques selected?
- If no: Return to catalog and be more specific
- If yes: Continue to Phase 4

## Phase 4: Systematic Application

**Goal:** Apply chosen techniques consistently throughout the entire design.

### Step 1: Apply Typography Changes
If typography is a chosen technique:
- Set up type scale (sizes, weights, line heights, spacing)
- Apply to ALL text (headlines, body, captions, tables, etc.)
- Ensure consistency across entire output
- Verify hierarchy is clear at every level

### Step 2: Apply Color Changes
If color is a chosen technique:
- Define palette (2-3 colors maximum)
- Apply to ALL elements (text, backgrounds, borders, charts, etc.)
- Ensure semantic meaning is consistent
- Verify accessibility (contrast ratios)

### Step 3: Apply Layout Changes
If layout is a chosen technique:
- Establish spacing scale
- Apply to ALL elements (margins, padding, gaps, etc.)
- Ensure grid alignment throughout
- Verify rhythm and consistency

### Step 4: Refinement Pass
Polish remaining elements:
- Shadows and borders (subtle, consistent)
- Rounding and corners (uniform)
- Visual elements (icons, dividers, etc.)
- Micro-interactions (if applicable)

**Quality gate:** Are techniques applied consistently throughout entire design?
- If no: Continue application until consistent
- If yes: Continue to Phase 5

## Phase 5: Quality Validation

**Goal:** Ensure the elevated design meets professional standards.

### Step 1: Final Interrogation Check
Review against interrogation checklist again:
- All typography questions answered
- All color questions answered
- All layout questions answered
- All hierarchy questions answered
- Context-specific criteria met

### Step 2: Exemplar Comparison
Compare to chosen exemplar:
- Would this fit in Stripe/Linear/Apple's design system?
- Are patterns borrowed correctly, not copied?
- Is the adaptation appropriate for context?
- Does it achieve similar quality standards?

### Step 3: Hand-Crafted Verification
Confirm it doesn't look template-based:
- Deliberate white space (not default padding)
- Typography relationships (not just bigger/bold)
- Color relationships (not generic defaults)
- Visual hierarchy (not just headings/body)
- Considered alignment (not just left-everything)

### Step 4: Red Flags Check
Ensure none of these are true:
- Using defaults without consideration
- More than 4 colors in palette
- No clear visual hierarchy
- Typography all one size/weight
- White space feels cramped
- Generic "professional" aesthetic
- Elements competing for attention
- Could swap with template unnoticed

**Quality gate:** Would you include this in a design portfolio?
- If no: Identify what's still missing and address
- If yes: Continue to Phase 6

## Phase 6: Delivery Preparation

**Goal:** Present the polished result appropriately.

### Step 1: Context Assessment
Determine if user needs to see process:
- Did they ask for design thinking?
- Did they request explanation?
- Is this a complex or unusual design?
- Are there important decisions to justify?

### Step 2: Delivery Format

**If process NOT needed (default):**
Present only the polished result:
- Deliver file directly
- Brief description of what was created
- Highlight key features or sections
- No mention of design process or techniques used

**If process IS needed:**
Present result with design rationale:
- Deliver polished file
- Explain 2-3 key design decisions
- Reference chosen exemplar
- Note techniques applied
- Keep explanation brief and specific

### Step 3: File Organization

For outputs requiring multiple files:
- Organize clearly (one main file or logical structure)
- Name files descriptively
- Include any necessary instructions
- Ensure all linked resources work

**Quality gate:** Is delivery format appropriate and files organized?
- If no: Reorganize before presenting
- If yes: Deliver to user

## Special Cases

### Time-Constrained Elevation
If limited time, prioritize:
1. Typography (biggest impact, fastest application)
2. Color palette (significant improvement, moderate effort)
3. Spacing consistency (good return, requires thoroughness)
4. Skip: Micro-refinements, experimental layouts

### Minimal Elevation (Simple Outputs)
For straightforward outputs:
- Phase 1: 5 minutes
- Phase 2: 2 minutes (quick interrogation)
- Phase 3: 2 minutes (select 1-2 techniques)
- Phase 4: 5 minutes (apply)
- Phase 5: 2 minutes (quick validation)
- Phase 6: 1 minute (deliver)

### Iterative Elevation
When user requests changes:
- Return to relevant phase based on feedback
- Don't restart from Phase 1 unless fundamental change
- Maintain consistency with previous decisions
- Validate new changes against interrogation checklist

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Skipping interrogation:**
- Don't jump straight to techniques
- Always identify what needs improvement first

**Over-applying techniques:**
- Don't use every technique from catalog
- 2-3 techniques maximum per design
- More techniques ≠ better design

**Inconsistent application:**
- Don't apply techniques to only part of design
- Consistency throughout is critical
- Half-elevated is worse than un-elevated

**Losing function for form:**
- Don't sacrifice usability for aesthetics
- Design serves content, not vice versa
- When in doubt, choose clarity

**Copying instead of adapting:**
- Don't replicate exemplar exactly
- Borrow principles and patterns, not pixels
- Adaptation shows understanding

**Explaining when not needed:**
- Don't present design thinking unless requested
- User wants result, not process (usually)
- Save detailed explanations for when asked
