# Content Strategy - 360 Client Portfolio Builder

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-16
**Purpose:** Writing guidelines, tone standards, and content patterns for portfolio pages

---

## Content Philosophy

### Grounded + Visionary

Write in a style that inspires possibility while staying anchored in reality. Show what could be without overselling what is.

**Good Example:**
> "We're validating a pay-as-you-go model that could make clean energy the default choice for 840 million people currently without electricity access."

**Bad Example (too corporate):**
> "Our innovative platform disrupts traditional paradigms in the energy sector, leveraging cutting-edge AI to optimize resource allocation."

**Bad Example (too informal):**
> "We're basically fixing the energy problem for a ton of people who don't have power."

---

### Professional but Human

Avoid jargon and corporate speak. Write like you're explaining to an intelligent colleague over coffee.

**Good Example:**
> "Traditional micro-grids are expensive because they're overbuilt for peak demand that rarely happens. Our AI predicts usage patterns and right-sizes the system, cutting costs by 40%."

**Bad Example:**
> "Our proprietary machine learning algorithms facilitate dynamic load optimization to maximize capital efficiency through predictive capacity planning."

---

### Specific over Generic

Use concrete examples, numbers, and names instead of vague claims. Every statement should be verifiable.

**Good Example:**
> "We've served 5,200 families across 12 communities in Kenya and Tanzania, delivering 450 MWh of clean energy in 18 months."

**Bad Example:**
> "We've achieved significant traction in multiple markets with strong impact metrics."

---

---

## Writing Guidelines

### 1. Lead with Impact, Then Explain How

Start with the outcome people care about, then explain the mechanism.

**Good:**
> "Rural families pay $3/month for reliable electricity (10x less than diesel generators) through our pay-as-you-go micro-grids."

**Bad:**
> "Our micro-grid architecture utilizes solar PV arrays with battery storage and mobile payment integration to enable affordable rural electrification."

---

### 2. Use Active Voice

Passive voice weakens writing and obscures agency. Show who's doing what.

**Good:**
> "We designed the system to handle variable loads."

**Bad:**
> "The system was designed to handle variable loads."

**Good:**
> "Our AI predicts usage patterns to optimize battery sizing."

**Bad:**
> "Usage patterns are predicted by our AI for battery sizing optimization."

---

### 3. One Idea Per Sentence

Long, complex sentences are hard to scan. Break them up for clarity.

**Good:**
> "Each micro-grid serves 50-200 households. Systems pay for themselves in 18 months. We're targeting 20 new installations in 2025."

**Bad:**
> "Each micro-grid, which serves between 50 and 200 households depending on density and load requirements, pays for itself in approximately 18 months, and we're targeting 20 new installations across East Africa in 2025."

---

### 4. Avoid Jargon (Or Explain It)

If you must use technical terms, explain them immediately.

**Good:**
> "We use AI to predict when people will use electricity (like evenings for cooking and lighting), so we can install smaller, cheaper batteries."

**Bad:**
> "Our predictive load management algorithms optimize battery sizing through temporal usage pattern analysis."

**When Jargon is Necessary:**
> "We've reached Technology Readiness Level 6 (TRL 6), meaning our system has been demonstrated in real-world conditions with paying customers."

---

### 5. Show, Don't Just Tell

Instead of claiming something, demonstrate it with data or examples.

**Good:**
> "Our systems have 98% uptime compared to 60-70% for diesel generators in the same regions."

**Bad:**
> "Our systems are highly reliable."

**Good:**
> "After connecting to our micro-grid, families report saving $15/month on energy costs and extending children's study time by 2 hours per evening."

**Bad:**
> "Our solution creates significant economic and educational benefits."

---

### 6. Use Numbers Strategically

Quantify wherever possible, but make numbers meaningful.

**Good Number Usage:**
- "Over 5,000 families" (specific, shows scale)
- "$250K in pilot contracts" (concrete financial traction)
- "3 Fortune 500 partnerships" (credible validation)
- "40% cost reduction vs. alternatives" (comparative value)

**Avoid:**
- "Thousands of users" (vague)
- "Significant revenue growth" (unmeasurable)
- "Industry-leading performance" (unverified claim)
- Excessive precision without context ("5,247 users" when "Over 5,000" is clearer)

**Add Context to Numbers:**
- "500 users in first 3 months" (shows velocity)
- "98% uptime (industry standard is 60-70%)" (shows comparison)
- "$1.2M grant from Gates Foundation" (credibility from source)

---

## Content Patterns by Section

### Hero Section

**Formula:** [Venture Name] + [Action Verb] + [Outcome for Beneficiaries]

**Length:** 10-15 words

**Examples:**

✅ "EcoGrid makes renewable energy accessible to rural communities through micro-grid technology."

We partner with local cooperatives for community trust and mobile money providers for seamless payments, creating a sustainable model that works in the markets traditional utilities have abandoned.

**Pattern:**
- Sentence 1: Core solution
- Sentence 2: Competitive advantage
- Sentence 3: Business model or partnership approach

---

### Traction & Milestones

**Structure:**
1. Lead with impact metrics (users, lives, outcomes)
2. Business validation (revenue, partnerships, contracts)
3. External recognition (awards, grants, media)

**Length:** 20-30 words per milestone

**Formatting Options:**
