## Translation Principles

1. **Outcome Over Process:** Translate what was learned, not what was done
2. **Specificity Over Generalization:** "78% would adopt" not "strong demand"
3. **Narrative Over Numbers:** Tell story with data as evidence
4. **Confidence Calibration:** Match claims to evidence level
