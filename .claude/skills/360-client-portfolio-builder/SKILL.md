## Core Philosophy

### Design Direction: Editorial Sophistication

**Aesthetic Goal:** High-end innovation studio meets creative agency. Make emerging ventures look credible and compelling without overselling or appearing corporate.

**Visual References to Emulate:**
- **Stripe** - Clarity, subtle animations, confident minimalism
- **Linear** - Precision, intentional spacing, purposeful interactions
- **Apple** - Product focus, white space, refined typography
- **Notion** - Accessible sophistication, playful without childish
- **Swiss Design** - Grid systems used then broken, typographic hierarchy

**Visual References to Avoid:**
- Startup pitch deck aesthetics (too much hype, gradient backgrounds)
- Corporate annual reports (sterile, overly formal, dense data tables)
- AI-generated gradients or obvious stock imagery
- Template-based layouts (overly symmetrical, cookie-cutter sections)
- Generic SaaS landing pages (feature lists, pricing tables)

### Design Principles

**1. Asymmetry with Purpose**

Don't default to centered layouts or rigid column grids. Use asymmetry to create visual interest and guide the eye.

**Good:**
- Text occupies left 60%, visual anchor on right 40%
- Section widths vary (some full-bleed, some constrained to 680px)
- Headers offset to left or right rather than centered
- Images break grid boundaries intentionally

**Avoid:**
- Perfectly centered everything
- Rigid 3-column layouts repeated throughout
- Equal spacing between all sections
- Predictable left-right alternation

---

**2. White Space as Design Element**

Negative space isn't wasted space. It creates breathing room, emphasizes content, and signals sophistication.

**Good:**
- Generous padding around sections (80-120px vertical)
- Variable spacing that creates rhythm (tight for related content, loose for transitions)
- Strategic emptiness that draws eye to focal points
- Margins that frame content like a gallery

**Avoid:**
- Cramming content to "fill the page"
- Uniform spacing throughout (monotonous)
- Fear of empty space
- Desktop-optimized spacing that breaks on mobile

---

**3. Typographic Hierarchy**

Typography should create clear information hierarchy and establish editorial quality.

**Good:**
- Serif + sans-serif pairing (editorial feel)
- Modular scale for predictable sizing (1.25 or 1.333 ratio)
- Line height 1.5-1.7 for readability
- Strategic weight variation (light for body, bold for emphasis)
- Optical alignment over mathematical precision

**Avoid:**
- More than 2-3 font families
- Default system fonts without intention
- Inconsistent sizing (no scale)
- Poor contrast (light gray on white)
- Justified text (ragged right is more readable)

---

**4. Color as Accent, Not Decoration**

Use color sparingly for emphasis and brand consistency. Let typography and layout do the heavy lifting.

**Good:**
- 360 brand colors in navigation, footer, subtle accents
- Client accent color (1-2 colors max) derived from sector or brand
- Neutral base (warm grays, off-whites, not pure black/white)
- Color used to signal interactivity (links, buttons, hover states)
- Sufficient contrast for accessibility (WCAG AA minimum)

**Avoid:**
- Rainbow effect (too many competing colors)
- Bright, saturated backgrounds
- Color used without purpose
- Poor contrast combinations
- Gradients for decoration rather than function

---

**5. Interactions That Enhance, Not Distract**

Every animation or interaction must serve a purpose. No motion for motion's sake.

**Good:**
- Scroll-triggered fade-ins for section headers
- Gentle transforms on hover (scale 1.02, shadow depth)
- Smooth transitions (300-400ms with ease-out easing)
- Progress indicators for long pages
- Subtle parallax on hero section (minimal, not distracting)

**Avoid:**
- Aggressive animations that feel like PowerPoint
- Parallax overuse (motion sickness)
- Slow transitions (over 500ms feels sluggish)
- Bouncing, spinning, or other decorative motion
- Animations that delay usability

---

**6. Hand-Crafted, Not Template-Based**

Every portfolio should feel custom-designed for that specific venture, not generated from a template.

**Achieve this through:**
- Varied section layouts (not repeating same pattern)
- Custom visual elements (abstract shapes, unique compositions)
- Unexpected details (asymmetric cards, offset images, varied rhythm)
- Client-specific color palette and imagery
- Organic flow rather than rigid structure

**Red flags for template feel:**
- Same hero layout on every portfolio
- Identical section ordering
- Consistent card sizing and spacing
- Generic stock imagery
- Predictable interactions

---

### Brand Balance: 360 + Client

Every portfolio page needs two layers:

**Layer 1: 360 Studios Presence**
- Logo or wordmark in navigation (top left or top right)
- Footer with "Partnership with 360 Social Impact Studios"
- Consistent use of 360 brand colors in UI elements
- "360 Partnership Context" section explaining support role
- Optional: Link to 360 website or contact

**Layer 2: Client Distinctiveness**
- Client name, logo, and mission take hero position
- Client-specific accent colors (not 360 palette)
- Sector-specific framing and language
- Client traction and milestones emphasized over 360 contributions
- Client call-to-action (not 360 CTA) as primary action

**Critical Rule:** 360 should create cohesion across portfolio pages (identifiable visual system), but never overshadow the client venture being showcased. The client is the hero, 360 is the enabling partner.

---

**Estimated Time:** 20-40 minutes for comprehensive outline

---

### Phase 3: Design & Visual System (45-90 minutes)

**Objective:** Create HTML structure, apply design system, implement interactions.

#### Step 3.1: Establish Color Palette

**360 Brand Colors (Consistent Across All Portfolios):**
```css
:root {
  --360-sage: #87A878;        /* Primary 360 brand color */
  --360-terracotta: #C97A63;  /* Secondary accent */
  --360-plum: #6B5B95;        /* Tertiary accent */
  --360-red: #C85A54;         /* Alert or emphasis */
  --360-gray: #4A5859;        /* Text and UI elements */
}
```

**Client Accent Colors (1-2 per portfolio):**

Derive from:
1. Client's existing brand (if they have one)
2. Sector conventions (e.g., green for climate/sustainability, blue for health)
3. Emotional tone (warm for community-focused, cool for tech-driven)

**Examples by Sector:**
- **CleanTech:** Deep green (#047857), Sky blue (#0EA5E9)
- **HealthTech:** Medical blue (#3B82F6), Coral (#FB7185)
- **EdTech:** Purple (#9333EA), Warm yellow (#F59E0B)
- **FinTech:** Navy (#1E3A8A), Gold (#D97706)
- **Social Innovation:** Sage (use 360 sage), Terracotta (use 360 terracotta)

**Neutral Base:**
```css
:root {
  --bg-primary: #FEFEFE;      /* Off-white, not pure white */
  --bg-secondary: #F8F9FA;    /* Light gray for sections */
  --text-primary: #1A1A1A;    /* Near-black, not pure black */
  --text-secondary: #6B7280;  /* Medium gray for supporting text */
}
```

**Accessibility Check:**
- All text on background must meet WCAG AA (4.5:1 contrast ratio for body, 3:1 for large text)
- Use WebAIM contrast checker: https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/

#### Step 3.2: Select Typography

**Recommended Pairings (Google Fonts):**

**Option 1: Classic Editorial**
- **Display/Headers:** Crimson Pro (serif, elegant)
- **Body/UI:** Inter (sans-serif, readable)
```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Crimson+Pro:wght@400;600;700&family=Inter:wght@400;500;600&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

**Option 2: Modern Sophistication**
- **Display/Headers:** Lora (serif, refined)
- **Body/UI:** Work Sans (sans-serif, geometric)
```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lora:wght@400;600;700&family=Work+Sans:wght@400;500;600&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

**Option 3: Contemporary Tech**
- **Display/Headers:** Fraunces (serif, playful)
- **Body/UI:** DM Sans (sans-serif, warm)
```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Fraunces:wght@400;600;700&family=DM+Sans:wght@400;500;600&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

**Typography Scale (Modular Scale 1.25):**
```css
:root {
  --text-xs: 0.64rem;   /* 10px - Captions, labels */
  --text-sm: 0.8rem;    /* 13px - Small text */
  --text-base: 1rem;    /* 16px - Body text */
  --text-lg: 1.25rem;   /* 20px - Large body */
  --text-xl: 1.563rem;  /* 25px - H4 */
  --text-2xl: 1.953rem; /* 31px - H3 */
  --text-3xl: 2.441rem; /* 39px - H2 */
  --text-4xl: 3.052rem; /* 49px - H1 */
  --text-5xl: 3.815rem; /* 61px - Display */
}
```

**Line Height:**
- Body text: 1.6-1.7 (optimal readability)
- Headers: 1.1-1.3 (tighter for impact)
- Large display: 1.0-1.1 (very tight)

#### Step 3.3: Build HTML Structure

Use semantic HTML5 with proper accessibility attributes. Every image needs alt text, use heading hierarchy properly, ensure keyboard navigation works, and meet WCAG AA color contrast standards.

#### Step 3.4: Implement CSS Layout

Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts. Implement asymmetric layouts (60/40, 70/30 splits), ensure mobile-first responsive design, and maintain generous vertical rhythm (80-120px section padding).

#### Step 3.5: Add Interactions & Animations

Implement scroll-triggered fade-ins using Intersection Observer API, add subtle hover effects on cards and links, ensure smooth scrolling for anchor links, and keep animations purposeful (300-400ms with ease-out easing).

**Estimated Time:** 45-90 minutes depending on complexity

---

### Phase 4: Content Writing & Refinement (30-45 minutes)

**Objective:** Write clear, compelling copy that translates Vianeo data into accessible narrative.

#### Key Writing Principles:

1. **Lead with Impact:** Start with outcomes, then explain mechanism
2. **Use Active Voice:** Strengthen writing by showing clear agency
3. **One Idea Per Sentence:** Break complex thoughts into scannable pieces
4. **Avoid Jargon:** Explain technical terms in accessible language
5. **Show, Don't Just Tell:** Use data and examples to demonstrate claims

#### Translate Vianeo Data:

**Technology Readiness Level (TRL) → Development Stage:**

| Vianeo TRL | Accessible Language |
|-----------|-------------------|
| TRL 1-2 | "Exploring concept and validating feasibility" |
| TRL 3-4 | "Developing and testing prototype with early users" |
| TRL 5-6 | "Pilot testing technology in real-world conditions" |
| TRL 7-8 | "Scaling proven solution to new markets and applications" |
| TRL 9 | "Mature technology in widespread operational use" |

**Market Validation → Traction Narrative:**

Instead of: "Completed 50 customer discovery interviews"

Use: "Validated demand through 50+ conversations with target customers, confirming that 78% would switch from current solution."

**Commercial Pathway → Business Model:**

Instead of: "Exploring B2B SaaS and freemium models with potential for government contracts"

Use: "Testing subscription pricing with early customers while building relationships with government agencies for potential long-term contracts."

**Estimated Time:** 30-45 minutes for all content

---

### Phase 5: Quality Assurance (15-20 minutes)

**Objective:** Validate design, content, technical quality before deployment.

#### Design Quality Check:
- Layout feels hand-crafted (not template-based)
- Asymmetry is intentional
- Typography hierarchy is clear
- Mobile responsive at 375px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px+

#### Content Quality Check:
- Value proposition clear in first 10 seconds
- Vianeo data translated to accessible language
- No jargon without explanation
- Metrics are specific
- Call-to-action is obvious

#### Technical Quality Check:
- Page loads under 3 seconds on 4G
- Images optimized (WebP preferred, compressed)
- WCAG AA accessibility (contrast, alt text, keyboard navigation)
- Works in Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge
- No console errors

**Estimated Time:** 15-20 minutes

---

### Phase 6: Deployment (10-15 minutes)

**Objective:** Publish live on internet with clear update instructions.

#### Quick Deployment (Netlify Drop):

1. Save HTML file as `index.html`
2. Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
3. Drag file into upload zone
4. Share generated live URL

#### Production Deployment (Netlify Account):

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues:

**Portfolio feels too template-based**
→ Break symmetry, vary section layouts, add unexpected visual elements

**Vianeo data sounds too technical**
→ Review translation guide, focus on outcomes not methodology, use examples

**Mobile layout breaks**
→ Test at 375px, 768px, 1024px breakpoints, stack asymmetric layouts on mobile

**Page loads slowly**
→ Optimize images (compress, use WebP), inline critical CSS, remove unused code

**360 brand overshadows client**
→ Make client name/logo larger, use client accent colors, keep 360 section brief

---

## Success Metrics

**For Each Portfolio:**
- Built in under 2 hours
- Client approves without major revisions
- Loads under 3 seconds on mobile
