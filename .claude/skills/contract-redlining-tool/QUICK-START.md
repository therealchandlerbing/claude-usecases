---

## 3-Step Quick Use

### Step 1: Provide Contract + Context

**Upload or paste contract** and provide context:

```
"Review this partnership agreement. It's a balanced deal with a Brazilian
biotech company. Main concerns: payment timing and IP ownership."

"Analyze this client services contract. They're a critical strategic partner,
but I'm worried about unlimited revisions and Net 60 payment terms."

"Redline this MoU with a U.S. foundation. It's exploratory, but they want
immediate exclusive rights which seems premature."
```

**Required context:**
- Deal type (Client Services, Partnership, MoU, Joint Venture)
- Strategic importance (Critical / High / Medium / Standard)
- Power dynamics (We need them / Balanced / They need us)
- Key concerns (payment, IP, liability, scope, etc.)
- Geographic context (US / Brazil / Europe / Other)

### Step 2: System Analyzes Against 360 Standards

Skill automatically:
- ✅ Classifies deal type and applies standard positions
- ✅ Identifies critical risks (deal-breakers)
- ✅ Detects high-priority issues
- ✅ Recommends standard improvements
- ✅ Generates protective clause language
- ✅ Tailors to cultural/geographic context

### Step 3: Receive Attorney-Quality Deliverables

You'll get:
1. **Redlined .docx** - Tracked changes with margin comments
2. **Executive Summary** - 1-page risk assessment
3. **Negotiation Brief** - Talking points and compromise options

**Time:** 15-30 minutes (vs. 2-4 hours with attorney)

---

## Risk Classification System

### 🚨 **CRITICAL (Deal-Breakers)**
**Must fix or walk away:**
- Unlimited liability
- IP assignment of 360 methodologies/frameworks
- Payment contingent on subjective satisfaction
- One-sided termination without payment for work done
- Automatic renewal without escape rights
- Equity without governance/information rights

**Action:** Push hard, escalate to leadership, consider walking away

---

### ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY (Must Fix)**
**Strong negotiation required:**
- Payment terms over Net 45 days
- Unlimited revisions or scope creep
- One-way indemnification
- Immediate exclusivity without performance requirements
- Commission due before payment received
- Broad non-compete (>12 months or wide geography)

**Action:** Propose specific redlines, explain business impact, find middle ground

---

### 📋 **STANDARD (Best Practice)**
**Negotiate if possible, document if accepted:**
- Missing termination for convenience
- No limitation of consequential damages
- Vague scope language
- Missing change order process
- Weak confidentiality protections
- Assignment without consent

**Action:** Propose improvements, accept if partner pushes back, document reasoning

## International Deal Considerations

- **Cultural:** Longer relationship-building, senior leader approval, formal communication

### European Partnerships 🇪🇺
- **Data Privacy:** GDPR compliance required

## Example Review Workflow

```
User: "Review this partnership agreement with a Brazilian biotech company.
      Strategic importance: High. Power dynamics: Balanced. Main concerns:
      IP ownership and payment timing."

System Analysis:
├─ Deal Type: Partnership Agreement
├─ Geography: Brazil (apply CCBC arbitration, currency protection)
├─ Risks Detected:
│  ├─ 🚨 CRITICAL: IP clause assigns all deliverables AND methodologies to partner
│  ├─ ⚠️ HIGH: Commission paid before 360 receives customer payment
│  └─ 📋 STANDARD: No non-compete limitation after termination
└─ Cultural Context: Relationship-first, formal communication, senior approval

Redlines Generated:
1. IP Clause: Changed from "all work product" to "deliverables only, 360 retains methodologies"
2. Payment Clause: Changed from "upon invoice" to "upon 360 receipt of customer payment"
3. Non-Compete: Added 12-month limitation, narrow to biotech sector in Brazil

Negotiation Brief:
- Lead with IP protection (non-negotiable)
- Payment timing is health of partnership issue (emphasize mutual benefit)
- Non-compete is standard practice (show other partnership agreements)
- Emphasize long-term relationship-building (Brazilian cultural norm)

Time: 20 minutes
```

---

## Non-Negotiables

360 will **NOT** accept:
- ❌ IP assignment of methodologies, frameworks, or tools
- ❌ Unlimited liability without caps
- ❌ Payment contingent on subjective "satisfaction"
- ❌ One-sided termination without payment for completed work
- ❌ Equity without governance/information rights
- ❌ Automatic renewal without termination rights

**If partner insists on non-negotiables:** Escalate to leadership and consider walking away.

## Common Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Client Services Contract Review
```
Request: "Review this contract for ConnectMyVariant consulting project.
         They're a strategic partner, but payment terms are Net 60."

Output:
- 🚨 CRITICAL: Unlimited revisions clause → Add 2-round limit
- ⚠️ HIGH: Net 60 payment → Push for Net 30 (or 50/50 upfront/milestone)
- 📋 STANDARD: Missing liability cap → Add cap at fees paid

Negotiation: Lead with revisions limit (scope protection),
            use payment as secondary issue if they're strategic
```

### Use Case 2: Brazilian Partnership Agreement
```
Request: "Redline this partnership with CNEN for nuclear tech licensing.
         Critical strategic importance, but they have leverage."

Output:
- 🚨 CRITICAL: No currency protection → Add PTAX rate clause
- ⚠️ HIGH: Exclusive rights without performance minimums → Add first-sale + minimum revenue requirements
- 📋 STANDARD: Washington law → Change to Brazilian law with CCBC arbitration

Cultural: Emphasize long-term partnership, propose relationship-building
         milestones before exclusivity kicks in
```

### Use Case 3: MoU for Exploratory Partnership
```
Request: "Review this MoU with a foundation. They want confidentiality
         and exclusivity, but it's just exploration phase."

Output:
- ⚠️ HIGH: Binding exclusivity in non-binding MoU → Remove or make conditional
- 📋 STANDARD: One-way confidentiality → Make mutual
- 💡 OPPORTUNITY: Add 1-year term with auto-renew and 30-day out

Negotiation: Frame MoU as relationship-building tool, not binding agreement
```

## Troubleshooting

**"Too many redlines, partner will pushback"**
→ Separate into must-wins (Critical + High Priority) vs. nice-to-haves (Standard)
→ Lead with must-wins, drop Standard items if needed

**"Cultural context not being applied"**
→ Explicitly state geography and cultural norms in request
→ Mention if relationship-building or transaction-focused partner

**"Redlines too aggressive for strategic deal"**
→ Specify strategic importance and power dynamics in request
→ System will soften language and offer more compromise options

**"Need to explain business impact to non-legal stakeholders"**
→ Use Executive Summary (designed for business audience)
→ Focus on "what could go wrong" examples in margin comments
