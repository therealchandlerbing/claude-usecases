# Contract Redlining Examples: Before & After
**360 Social Impact Studios**
*Actual clause redlining demonstrations*

---

## How to Read These Examples

Each example shows:
1. **Original clause** from a sample contract (as might be received from partner)
2. **Redlined version** (with strikethrough deletions and underlined additions)
3. **Margin comment** explaining the issue and proposed fix
4. **Deal context** showing when this pattern applies

These examples are based on patterns from real 360 contract negotiations.

## Example Set 1: Client Services Contracts

### Example 1A: Payment Terms (Standard Client)

**Deal Context:** Standard client engagement, $26K professional services contract, balanced negotiating position

**Original Clause:**
```
Payment terms: Client shall pay Consultant upon receipt of satisfactory
deliverables. Payment due Net 60 days from invoice.
```

**Redlined Version:**
```
Payment terms: ~~Client shall pay Consultant upon receipt of satisfactory deliverables.~~
**Consultant shall invoice Client according to the payment schedule in Section 3.2.
Deliverables deemed accepted if no written objection within ten (10) business days of
delivery.** Payment due Net ~~60~~ **30** days from invoice **date. Late payments subject
to interest at one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month.**
```

**Margin Comment:**
```
[⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY] Problematic payment structure

Issues:
1. "Satisfactory deliverables" is subjective - could delay payment indefinitely
2. Net 60 is extended payment term, creates cash flow issues
3. No consequences for late payment
4. No acceptance timeline

Proposed fixes:
- Tie payment to delivery, not subjective satisfaction
- Add 10-day acceptance window (silence = acceptance)
- Reduce to Net 30 (industry standard)
- Add 1.5% monthly interest for late payments

Business impact: Original terms could delay payment by 90+ days (60 days + dispute time).
Revised terms ensure payment within 40 days maximum.

Negotiation note: If client pushes back on Net 30, compromise at Net 45 but remove
"satisfactory" language (non-negotiable).
```

### Example 1B: Scope Definition (Video Production)

**Deal Context:** Video content creation, multiple deliverables, need scope protection

**Original Clause:**
```
Consultant will produce educational videos in Spanish and Portuguese to support
Client's mission. Consultant will make revisions as needed to ensure Client's
satisfaction with final product.
```

**Redlined Version:**
```
Consultant will produce **five (5)** educational videos in Spanish and Portuguese
**covering the topics specified in Section 1.2(b), each approximately ten (10)
minutes in duration.** ~~to support Client's mission.~~ Consultant will **provide
one (1) round of revisions per video based on Client's written feedback. Additional
revision rounds available at $500 per video per round.** ~~make revisions as needed
to ensure Client's satisfaction with final product.~~
```

**Margin Comment:**
```
[🚨 CRITICAL] Unlimited scope and revisions

Issues:
1. "Educational videos" is vague - how many? what length? what topics?
2. "Revisions as needed" = unlimited free revisions
3. "Client's satisfaction" is subjective standard, unachievable target

Proposed fixes:
- Specify exact number (5 videos)
- Define video length and topics (reference Section 1.2(b))
- Limit revisions to 1 round per video
- Price additional rounds at $500 each
- Remove subjective "satisfaction" language

Business impact: Original terms could mean 20+ revision rounds at no additional cost.
One client requested 7 rounds on a single video. This clause prevents that.

Compromise option: If client wants more flexibility, offer 2 revision rounds included,
but NO unlimited revisions under any circumstances.
```

---

### Example 1C: IP Ownership (Deliverables)

**Deal Context:** Strategic consulting with custom deliverables

**Original Clause:**
```
All work product, including reports, presentations, frameworks, and methodologies
developed by Consultant during the engagement shall be the exclusive property of
Client. Consultant shall not use or disclose such work product without Client's
prior written consent.
```

**Redlined Version:**
```
All **final deliverables specifically created for Client** ~~work product~~, including
**custom** reports, presentations, ~~frameworks, and methodologies~~ **and analyses**
developed by Consultant during the engagement shall be the ~~exclusive~~ property of
Client. **Consultant retains all rights to: (a) pre-existing methodologies, frameworks,
templates, and tools; (b) general knowledge, experience, and skills gained during the
engagement; and (c) processes and approaches used to create deliverables. Consultant
may use de-identified, anonymized examples from deliverables for portfolio and marketing
purposes.** Consultant shall not use or disclose ~~such work product~~ **Client's
confidential business information** without Client's prior written consent.
```

**Margin Comment:**
```
[🚨 CRITICAL] Overly broad IP assignment threatens 360's business model

Issues:
1. "All work product" includes 360's core methodologies and frameworks
2. "Frameworks and methodologies" are 360's primary business assets
3. No ability to use examples for future marketing or portfolio
4. Prevents 360 from using general knowledge gained

Proposed fixes:
- Limit assignment to "final deliverables specifically created for Client"
- Explicitly retain rights to pre-existing IP, methodologies, frameworks
- Retain rights to general knowledge and experience
- Allow de-identified portfolio use
- Narrow confidentiality to actual confidential business info

Business impact: Original clause would prevent 360 from using its own strategic
frameworks with future clients and from showcasing this work in portfolio.

This is a deal-breaker. 360 cannot sign contracts assigning methodology IP.

Non-negotiable position: Client owns final deliverables, 360 retains methodologies
and portfolio rights. If client refuses, walk away.
```

## Example Set 2: Partnership/Distribution Agreements

### Example 2A: Commission Structure

**Deal Context:** Latin America distribution partnership, software + services resale

**Original Clause:**
```
360 Social Impact Studios shall pay Partner forty percent (40%) commission on all
sales generated by Partner in the Territory. Commission shall be paid within 15 days
of contract signature with Customer.
```

**Redlined Version:**
```
360 Social Impact Studios shall pay Partner ~~forty~~ **thirty** percent ~~(40%)~~
**(30%)** commission on **software license sales and twenty-five percent (25%)
commission on professional services sales** ~~all sales~~ generated by Partner in
the Territory. Commission shall be paid within ~~15~~ **30** days of ~~contract
signature with Customer~~ **360 receiving full payment from Customer. If Customer
fails to pay or pays only a portion, commission shall be reduced proportionally or
eliminated. Commission payments shall include an itemized statement showing Customer
name, contract value, commission calculation, and any adjustments.**
```

**Margin Comment:**
```
[⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY] Commission structure exposes 360 to financial risk

Issues:
1. 40% commission rate is very high, reduces 360's margin significantly
2. Different products have different margin profiles (software vs. services)
3. Commission due before 360 receives payment creates cash flow risk
4. No protection if customer doesn't pay
5. 15-day payment to partner before 30-60 day payment from customer

Proposed fixes:
- Reduce to 30% for software, 25% for services (standard industry rates)
- Commission only paid after 360 receives customer payment
- Pro-rate or eliminate commission if customer doesn't pay
- Extend payment to 30 days to align with typical customer payment cycles
- Add transparency with itemized statements

Business impact: At 40% commission paid before receiving customer payment, 360 could
be out-of-pocket for months. Revised terms protect cash flow.

Negotiation approach:
- Lead with "commission only after payment received" (non-negotiable)
- Willing to discuss 35% on software if partner accepts payment timing
- 25% on services is firm (lower margins)
```

### Example 2B: Exclusivity Terms

**Deal Context:** New partnership in Brazil, unproven partner performance

**Original Clause:**
```
360 Social Impact Studios grants Partner exclusive rights to market, promote, and
sell all Solutions throughout Latin America for the duration of this Agreement.
```

**Redlined Version:**
```
360 Social Impact Studios ~~grants~~ **may grant** Partner ~~exclusive~~ **conditional
exclusive** rights to market, promote, and sell ~~all~~ **the** Solutions throughout
~~Latin America~~ **Brazil** ~~for the duration of this Agreement~~ **subject to the
following conditions: (a) Partner achieves first successful sale within six (6) months
of Effective Date; (b) Partner maintains minimum annual sales of $100,000 USD; (c)
Partner maintains good standing under this Agreement with no material breaches.
Exclusivity shall be reviewed quarterly. If performance conditions are not met, 360
may terminate exclusivity upon 30 days written notice while continuing the partnership
on a non-exclusive basis.**
```

**Margin Comment:**
```
[🚨 CRITICAL] Immediate exclusive rights without performance requirements

Issues:
1. Exclusive rights granted on day 1 before partner proves capability
2. "All Solutions" prevents 360 from working with other partners on different products
3. "Latin America" is entire continent (millions in potential revenue)
4. "Duration of Agreement" could be years with no escape clause
5. No performance requirements

Proposed fixes:
- Change to "conditional exclusivity" requiring first sale
- Narrow geography to Brazil only (partner's primary market)
- Add performance minimums ($100K annual sales)
- Quarterly review process
- Right to terminate exclusivity (but continue non-exclusive partnership)
- Limit to "the Solutions" not "all Solutions" (allows future product flexibility)

Business impact: Original clause locks up entire continent with unproven partner.
If partner fails to perform, 360 has no recourse and loses all other opportunities
in Latin America.

This is a deal-breaker for new partnerships.

Non-negotiable: Exclusivity only after proven performance. Willing to discuss
6-month conditional exclusivity in Brazil only.
```

### Example 2C: Non-Compete Duration

**Deal Context:** Partnership agreement, partner has competing capabilities

**Original Clause:**
```
Partner agrees not to compete with 360 Social Impact Studios by developing, marketing,
or selling competing solutions for the duration of this Agreement and for three (3)
years following termination.
```

**Redlined Version:**
```
Partner agrees not to ~~compete with 360 Social Impact Studios by~~ develop**ing**
~~, marketing, or selling~~ **for itself solutions that directly compete with the
core features and functions of** ~~competing~~ **the** solutions **covered by this
Agreement** for the duration of this Agreement and for ~~three (3)~~ **twelve (12)
months** following termination. **This restriction does not prevent Partner from:
(a) offering services to clients in the same industry; (b) using general skills and
knowledge gained during partnership; or (c) developing solutions for materially
different markets or use cases.**
```

**Margin Comment:**
```
[⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY] Overly broad non-compete may be unenforceable

Issues:
1. "Compete with 360" is vague - could prevent any overlap
2. "Marketing or selling competing solutions" is too broad (prevents reselling others)
3. Three years post-termination is excessive (likely unenforceable in many states)
4. No clarity on what constitutes "competing"

Proposed fixes:
- Narrow to "developing for itself solutions that directly compete"
- Define "compete" as core features/functions overlap
- Reduce to 12 months post-termination (standard and enforceable)
- Add carve-outs for general services, knowledge, and different markets
- Allow Partner to serve same industry (just not with directly competing product)

Legal note: Many states (including California) won't enforce non-competes over
12-18 months. Three years could void entire clause.

Business impact: 360 wants protection for its investment in partner training and
market development, but needs enforceable terms.

Negotiation approach: 12 months is firm. Focus enforcement on "developing competing
solutions" not "all competitive activity." Partner can still do business, just can't
clone 360's product.
```

## Example Set 3: Memoranda of Understanding

### Example 3A: Non-Binding Language (with Hidden Obligations)

**Deal Context:** Brazilian partnership exploration, early-stage MoU

**Original Clause:**
```
This MoU outlines the parties' intent to collaborate on strategic initiatives.
While this MoU is not a binding contract, both parties commit to working together
in good faith and shall dedicate appropriate resources to joint projects as they
are defined.
```

**Redlined Version:**
```
This MoU outlines the parties' intent to **explore potential** collaboration on
strategic initiatives. ~~While~~ this MoU is not a binding contract**; it does not
create legal obligations, financial commitments, or enforceable duties.** ~~, both
parties commit to working together in good faith and~~ **The parties agree to
discuss opportunities** ~~shall dedicate appropriate resources to joint projects~~
**on a case-by-case basis. Any specific projects** ~~as they are defined~~ **will
be formalized through separate written agreements specifying scope, timeline,
resources, and compensation.**
```

**Margin Comment:**
```
[⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY] Contradictory language creates binding obligations

Issues:
1. First sentence says "not binding" but second sentence uses binding language
2. "Commit to working together" sounds like enforceable obligation
3. "Dedicate appropriate resources" = financial commitment despite "non-binding"
4. No clarity on what happens if parties don't "commit" or "dedicate resources"

Proposed fixes:
- Change "intent to collaborate" to "intent to explore collaboration"
- Strengthen non-binding language with explicit no-obligations clause
- Change "commit" to "agree to discuss"
- Remove resource dedication language
- Add requirement for separate written agreements for any actual projects

Legal risk: Partner could argue this MoU creates binding obligation to fund joint
projects. Courts sometimes enforce "commitments" even in documents labeled "non-binding."

This language is particularly important for international MoUs where dispute resolution
is expensive.

Non-negotiable: MoU must be clearly non-binding with no resource commitments.
All projects require separate written agreements.
```

### Example 3B: Publicity Rights (Brazilian MoU)

**Deal Context:** Partnership with Brazilian biotech, sensitive negotiations in progress

**Original Clause:**
```
Both parties agree to the mutual right to announce and publicize their collaboration,
including sharing information about this project across social media platforms and
other marketing channels.
```

**Redlined Version:**
```
Both parties agree to the mutual right to announce and publicize their **general**
collaboration ~~, including sharing information about this project~~ **in high-level
terms**. **Specific announcements regarding deal structures, equity proposals,
valuation, financial terms, or proprietary business information require mutual
written approval before publication.** **Each party may:**

**- Announce the partnership generally (e.g., "360 and [Partner] are exploring
collaboration on innovation initiatives in Brazil")**
**- Include the other party in public lists of partners or collaborators**
**- Share de-identified, anonymized information internally for due diligence**

**Each party shall seek written approval before:**
**- Press releases with specific deal terms**
**- Social media posts disclosing financial information**
**- Detailed announcements of equity, investment, or valuation**
~~across social media platforms and other marketing channels.~~
```

**Margin Comment:**
```
[📋 STANDARD] Publicity rights too broad, creates disclosure risk

Issues:
1. "Information about this project" could include sensitive deal terms
2. No approval process before public announcements
3. No protection for confidential financial or strategic information
4. Could harm ongoing negotiations if partner discloses terms prematurely

Proposed fixes:
- Distinguish between general collaboration (freely announceable) and deal
  specifics (requires approval)
- Create allowable list (general partnership, de-identified info for internal use)
- Create approval-required list (press releases, financial terms, deal structures)
- Protect equity proposals, valuations, proprietary info

Business impact: During due diligence on Brazilian biotech investment, premature
disclosure of proposed valuation could:
- Spook other investors
- Trigger competitor interest
- Complicate other deals in pipeline
- Give partner negotiating leverage

This is especially important in venture investments where term sheets are
confidential until close.

Negotiation note: Partner will likely want some publicity rights (important for
their credibility). Compromise by allowing general announcement but protecting
deal specifics. This is standard in MoUs.
```

## Example Set 4: International Deal Provisions

### Example 4A: Governing Law (Brazilian Partnership)

**Deal Context:** Partnership with Brazilian company, potential for disputes

**Original Clause:**
```
This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Washington. Any disputes
arising from this Agreement shall be resolved in the courts of King County, Washington.
```

**Redlined Version:**
```
This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of ~~the State of Washington~~ **the
Federal Republic of Brazil**. Any disputes arising from this Agreement shall be
resolved ~~in the courts of King County, Washington~~ **through binding arbitration
in São Paulo, Brazil, administered by Câmara de Comércio Brasil-Canadá (CCBC) pursuant
to its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. The arbitration shall be conducted
by a sole arbitrator who shall apply Brazilian law. Judgment on the award may be entered
in any court having competent jurisdiction. Each party retains the right to seek
preliminary injunctive relief in courts of competent jurisdiction to protect intellectual
property or confidential information.**
```

**Margin Comment:**
```
[💡 OPPORTUNITY] Jurisdictional mismatch for international partnership

Context:
This is a partnership with a Brazilian company. Having Washington law and jurisdiction
creates several problems for the partnership:

1. Brazilian partner must litigate in U.S. (expensive, unfamiliar legal system)
2. Enforcing Washington judgment in Brazil is complex and costly
3. Brazilian courts may not recognize U.S. judgment
4. Creates imbalance favoring 360 (appears unfair)

Proposed fixes:
- Change to Brazilian governing law (partner's home jurisdiction)
- Use CCBC arbitration (respected institution for Brazil-international disputes)
- Arbitration more efficient than litigation for cross-border disputes
- Preserve ability to seek injunctive relief for IP protection
- Single arbitrator keeps costs manageable

Strategic benefit: Proposing Brazilian law/arbitration shows respect for partner and
levels playing field. Arbitration is actually better for 360 than U.S. litigation
because:
- Faster resolution
- Lower costs (no international travel for court dates)
- Award enforceable in Brazil under New York Convention
- Confidential (unlike public court proceedings)

Cultural note: Brazilian partners appreciate when U.S. companies accept Brazilian
jurisdiction. Shows good faith and long-term commitment.

For U.S. partners, retain Washington law and jurisdiction. Only change for legitimate
international partnerships.
```

### Example 4B: Currency and Payment (International)

**Deal Context:** Services contract with Brazilian client, payment in USD

**Original Clause:**
```
All payments shall be made in U.S. Dollars within thirty (30) days of invoice.
```

**Redlined Version:**
```
All payments shall be made in U.S. Dollars within thirty (30) days of invoice.
**If Client requires payment in Brazilian Reais due to local banking restrictions,
the exchange rate shall be the official PTAX rate published by Banco Central do
Brasil on the invoice date. Client is responsible for all currency conversion fees
and wire transfer charges. Neither party shall be liable for currency fluctuations
between invoice date and payment date. All payments shall be made via international
wire transfer to the bank account specified by Consultant. Payment shall be deemed
complete when funds are received in Consultant's account (not when wire is initiated).**
```

**Margin Comment:**
```
[📋 STANDARD] International payment protections needed

Issues with original clause:
1. Doesn't address currency conversion (Brazilian clients may not have USD accounts)
2. No specified exchange rate (could dispute conversion rate)
3. Doesn't allocate wire transfer fees (often $40-80 per transfer)
4. "Payment within 30 days" unclear if that means "wire sent" or "funds received"
5. No protection for currency fluctuation

Proposed additions:
- Allow payment in BRL if necessary (practical reality)
- Use official PTAX rate from Central Bank (transparent, verifiable)
- Lock exchange rate to invoice date (protects both parties from fluctuation)
- Client pays all bank fees (standard for international payments)
- Payment complete when funds received (accounts for 3-5 day wire processing)

Business impact: International wire transfers can take 5-7 business days. Without
"funds received" language, client could claim payment on day 30 but funds arrive
day 37, technically making 360's payment late.

Brazilian context: PTAX is the official exchange rate published daily by Brazilian
Central Bank. Using this rate prevents disputes about conversion.

Wire transfer fees: International wires from Brazil typically cost $50-80. Having
client pay these fees prevents them from deducting from payment.

This language is standard for international contracts and shouldn't be controversial.
```

## Example Set 5: Joint Venture / Equity Deals

### Example 5A: Equity and Board Rights

**Deal Context:** 360 (via Enough Ventures) taking 20% equity stake in portfolio company

**Original Clause:**
```
Investor shall receive twenty percent (20%) equity in the Company in exchange for
$400,000 investment. Major decisions shall require approval of shareholders holding
at least fifty-one percent (51%) of equity.
```

**Redlined Version:**
```
Investor shall receive twenty percent (20%) equity in the Company in exchange for
$400,000 investment. Major decisions shall require approval of shareholders holding
at least ~~fifty-one~~ **seventy-five** percent ~~(51%)~~ **(75%)** of equity**,
which shall include the following: (a) amendments to governing documents; (b)
issuance of new equity or debt securities; (c) sale or merger of the Company;
(d) acquisition of another company; (e) change of business direction; (f) hiring
or termination of C-level executives; (g) capital expenditures exceeding $50,000;
(h) related-party transactions.** **Investor shall be entitled to: (i) one (1)
board seat or board observer rights; (ii) quarterly financial statements and annual
audited financials; (iii) written notice of all board meetings at least ten (10)
days in advance; (iv) pro-rata participation rights in future funding rounds.**
```

**Margin Comment:**
```
[🚨 CRITICAL] Minority equity position without protections

Issues:
1. 51% threshold allows 51% shareholder to control all major decisions
2. 360 has 20% equity but zero control or board representation
3. No definition of "major decisions" (could be very narrow)
4. No information rights (can't even see financials)
5. No protection against dilution in future rounds

Proposed fixes:
- Increase to 75% threshold (requires broad consensus, protects minority)
- Define "major decisions" comprehensively (8 key categories listed)
- Add board seat or observer rights (visibility into operations)
- Require quarterly financials and annual audit (monitoring rights)
- Add pro-rata rights (maintain % ownership in future rounds)
- Advance notice of board meetings (can't be excluded from decisions)

Business impact: Without these protections, majority shareholders could:
- Sell company without 360's consent
- Dilute 360's ownership to <5% through new equity issuance
- Pay themselves excessive salaries through related-party transactions
- Make decisions without 360's knowledge

This is a deal-breaker for minority investments.

Venture capital standard: Investors with 15-25% typically get:
- Board seat or observer rights
- Veto rights on major decisions (75%+ threshold)
- Information rights (quarterly financials minimum)
- Pro-rata participation in future rounds

Non-negotiable: Board representation + major decision protections + information
rights. These are standard minority investor protections.
```

### Example 5B: IP Ownership in Failed Ventures

**Deal Context:** Joint venture to develop new technology platform

**Original Clause:**
```
All intellectual property developed during the joint venture shall be owned by the
joint venture entity. Upon dissolution of the joint venture, intellectual property
shall be distributed according to equity ownership percentages.
```

**Redlined Version:**
```
All intellectual property developed **jointly** during the joint venture shall be
owned by the joint venture entity. **Each party retains ownership of intellectual
property it develops independently, even if related to the joint venture's business.
"Background IP" (IP owned by a party before the joint venture) remains that party's
property.** Upon dissolution of the joint venture, intellectual property shall be
~~distributed according to equity ownership percentages~~ **handled as follows:
(a) Background IP reverts to the party that owned it originally; (b) jointly-developed
IP may be purchased by any party at fair market value (determined by independent
valuation if parties disagree); (c) if no party purchases, jointly-developed IP shall
be sold to third parties with proceeds distributed according to equity ownership;
(d) each party receives a non-exclusive license to use jointly-developed IP for
non-competing purposes.**
```

**Margin Comment:**
```
[⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY] IP ownership unclear, creates disputes in failure scenarios

Issues:
1. "All intellectual property" doesn't distinguish joint vs. independent development
2. Doesn't address pre-existing IP (Background IP)
3. "Equity ownership percentages" may not reflect IP contribution
4. Creates forced sale at dissolution (could lose valuable IP)
5. No license rights if venture fails

Proposed fixes:
- Distinguish jointly-developed IP from independent and background IP
- Protect pre-existing IP (each party keeps what they brought)
- Create purchase option at dissolution (fair market value)
- Allow third-party sale if no party wants to purchase
- Include non-exclusive license rights (can still use IP for other purposes)

Business impact: Venture fails after 2 years. 360 contributed proprietary
methodology. Under original clause:
- Methodology becomes venture property
- Gets "distributed by equity percentage" (unclear what this means)
- 360 can't use own methodology for other clients
- Could be forced to buy back own IP at inflated price

Under revised clause:
- 360's background methodology stays 360's property
- Jointly-developed platform can be purchased at fair value
- If no purchase, sold to third party for cash distribution
- 360 can still use platform for non-competing purposes

University partnership note: Similar issues arise in university collaborations.
Background IP must be clearly protected.

Negotiation approach: This is complex and often requires attorney involvement.
The key principle: "You keep what you brought, we share what we built together,
and everyone has a path forward if venture dissolves."
```

## Implementation Notes

These examples should be incorporated into the contract redlining tool's pattern library. When the tool encounters similar language patterns, it should:

1. **Detect** the problematic clause using pattern matching
2. **Categorize** the issue severity based on deal context
3. **Redline** using approved protective language
4. **Comment** with business-focused explanation
5. **Suggest** negotiation approach

The margin comments should always include:
- What the issue is (technical legal problem)
- Why it matters (business impact)
- Proposed fix (specific language)
- Negotiation guidance (when to hold firm vs. compromise)
