### US-Based Agreements
- **Governing Law**: Washington State law
- **Venue**: Seattle, Washington (exclusive for LOI)
- **Dispute Resolution**: Good faith negotiation (30 days) → Mediation → Litigation
- **No Arbitration**: Standard litigation path for domestic deals

### Brazil-Based Agreements
- **Governing Law**: Laws of the Federative Republic of Brazil

---

## Payment and Pricing Patterns

### Expense Handling

- **Reimbursable**: Only if specified in approved budget

---

## IP and Licensing Frameworks

### Work Product Created Under Agreement
- **Ownership**: Transfers to client upon full payment of all fees

## Red Flags and Deal Killers

### Immediate Concerns (Require Significant Revision)

   - Consequential damages allowed
   - Indemnification without limits

2. **Unbalanced IP Terms**
   - Client ownership of pre-existing materials

   - Unrestricted client use of 360's tools

3. **Impossible Performance Standards**
   - Unlimited revisions

   - No dispute resolution process
   - Unilateral venue selection by client

### Moderate Concerns (Negotiate but May Accept)

1. **Payment Timing**
   - Less than 50% upfront (may accept 40/60 or 30/70 depending on relationship)
   - Milestone structure tied to deliverables (acceptable if milestones are clear and achievable)

2. **Scope Definition**
   - Somewhat vague deliverables (can clarify in exhibits)
   - Flexible service descriptions (may work if change order process included)

3. **Confidentiality**
   - Longer survival periods (can accept up to 5 years)
   - Broader definition (acceptable if exceptions are clear)

4. **Governing Law**
   - Partner's home jurisdiction (acceptable if not unfamiliar territory)
   - Arbitration location (can negotiate if expensive to access)

### Low Concerns (Accept as Standard Market Terms)

1. **Representations and Warranties**
   - Standard professional services reps
   - Authority to enter agreement
   - Non-infringement of third party rights

2. **Insurance Requirements**
   - Professional liability insurance

## Implementation Notes for Contract Redlining Tool

### When Analyzing Incoming Contracts

1. **Identify Deal Type First**
   - Is this a services agreement, JV, partnership, or NDA?
   - Select appropriate reference pattern from this document
   - Flag major structural deviations

2. **Check Standard Protective Terms**
   - Is there a liability cap? (Should be fees paid)
   - Is there termination for convenience? (Should be 60 days)
   - Are IP rights properly divided? (Work product to client, pre-existing to 360)
   - Is confidentiality mutual with reasonable survival? (3-5 years)

3. **Verify Payment Structure**
   - Services: Looking for 50/50 or 40/60 milestone structure
   - JV: Looking for profit waterfall and percentage-based fees
   - Are there any satisfaction contingencies? (Flag as critical issue)

4. **Review Jurisdiction/Dispute Resolution**
   - US deals: Washington State law preferred
   - Brazil deals: Brazilian law + CAM-CCBC arbitration
   - International deals: Consider arbitration over litigation

5. **Assess Timeline and Commitment Terms**
   - Is there a pilot period for JVs?
   - Are revision rounds specified for deliverables?
   - Is non-solicitation period reasonable (<= 12 months)?

6. **Cultural Context**
   - Brazilian partners: Expect more formal structure, arbitration preference
   - US partners: More transactional, litigation acceptable
   - Academic partners: Publication rights, IP sensitivities

### Generating Redlines

1. **Use 360's Proven Language**
   - Copy protective terms from this document where applicable
   - Don't reinvent language that 360 has successfully used

2. **Explain Deviations from 360's Standards**
   - In margin comments, note: "360's standard position is [X]. This draft proposes [Y]."
   - Quantify risk where possible: "This unlimited liability clause exposes 360 to damages far exceeding the $26K fee."

3. **Prioritize Issues**
   - Critical: Liability, IP, termination, payment structure
   - High: Confidentiality, governing law, warranties
   - Standard: Administrative provisions, notice requirements
   - Opportunity: Additional protections not in original draft

4. **Suggest Compromise Language**
   - When 360's standard may be difficult to achieve, offer middle ground
   - Note: "If 50/50 payment split is non-negotiable, suggest 40/60 with clear milestone definition"

5. **Consider Relationship Context**
   - New partner: More protective stance
   - Established relationship: May accept more flexibility
   - Strategic deal: Balance protection with deal momentum
