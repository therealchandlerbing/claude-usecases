## Core Knowledge Base: 360's Standard Contract Patterns

### 1. Client Services Contracts (ConnectMyVariant Model)

**Standard Clauses 360 Uses:**

- **Payment Structure**: 50% upfront, 50% at major milestone (typically year 2 for multi-year)
- **Independent Contractor Status**: Always included, 360 responsible for own taxes/insurance
- **Deliverable-Based Scope**: Specific outputs with revision rounds (typically 1-2 rounds)
- **Timeline Commitments**: Quarterly deliverables with structured service timelines
- **Termination Rights**: Typically allows either party to terminate with 30-60 days notice
- **Liability Protection**: Client responsible for accuracy of content they provide
- **Work Product Ownership**: Client owns final deliverables, 360 retains process/methodology

**Common Negotiation Points:**

**Payment Terms**
- Partners often request: Net 30 or Net 60 payment terms
- 360's position: Payment within 15 days preferred, will accept 30 days for established partners
- Compromise: 50% within 15 days, 50% within 30 days of milestone

**Scope Creep Protection**
- Partners often request: Open-ended revisions or "additional support as needed"
- 360's position: Specific deliverable counts with defined revision rounds
- Compromise: 1-2 revision rounds included, additional rounds billed at hourly rate

**Termination Provisions**
- Partners often request: Termination for convenience without penalty
- 360's position: Work completed to date must be paid in full
- Compromise: Either party can terminate with 30 days notice, pro-rated payment for work in progress

**Red Flags to Detect:**

- Unlimited revision clauses
- Payment contingent on subjective approval ("to client's satisfaction")
- Automatic contract renewal without notice period
- Liability for client's use of deliverables
- Non-compete extending beyond scope of engagement
- IP assignment of 360's methodologies or tools

**360-Specific Protections to Insert:**

```
"Consultant retains all rights to methodologies, processes, tools, and frameworks
developed independently or prior to this engagement. Client receives a license to
use deliverables for internal purposes only."

"Additional requests beyond the scope defined in Section 1 shall be subject to
separate scope of work and additional compensation at Consultant's standard rates."

"Payment terms: 50% due within fifteen (15) days of contract execution, 50% due
at [milestone]. Late payments subject to 1.5% monthly interest charge."
```

---

### 2. Ecosystem Partner / Sales Agreements

**Standard Clauses 360 Uses:**

- **Commission Structure**: 25-30% on sales generated (30% for software licenses, 25% for services)
- **Exclusivity Terms**: Granted conditionally after first successful sale, reviewed at 6-month intervals
- **Non-Compete**: 12 months post-termination, limited to directly competing solutions
- **Prospect Registration**: 6-month protection period for registered leads
- **Training Requirements**: Partner responsible for certification costs
- **Marketing Approval**: Mutual approval required for publicity
- **Payment Timing**: Commission paid only after 360 receives payment from end customer

**Common Negotiation Points:**

**Commission Rates**
- Partners often request: 40-50% commission rates
- 360's position: 25-30% standard (depending on service type)
- Compromise: Tiered structure (30% for first $100K, 35% above that)

**Exclusivity**
- Partners often request: Immediate exclusive rights to entire region
- 360's position: Exclusivity granted after first sale, reviewed quarterly
- Compromise: 6-month conditional exclusivity upon first successful sale

**Non-Compete Duration**
- Partners often request: No non-compete or 3-6 months max
- 360's position: 12 months to protect investment in partner development
- Compromise: 12 months but limited to "substantially similar solutions in same market"

**Prospect Protection Period**
- Partners often request: 12-24 month protection on registered leads
- 360's position: 6 months (refreshable if active engagement continues)
- Compromise: 6 months initial, renewable for 6 more if partner demonstrates active pursuit

**Red Flags to Detect:**

- Commission due before 360 receives customer payment
- Exclusive rights without performance requirements
- Unlimited non-compete geographic scope
- Partner can appoint sub-partners without approval
- Automatic commission on renewals without partner involvement
- 360 liable for partner's representations to customers

**360-Specific Protections to Insert:**

```
"Commissions become due and payable only after Company receives full payment from
Customer. If Customer fails to pay, no commission is owed."

"Exclusivity in [Territory] is conditional upon Partner achieving minimum annual
sales of $[amount] and maintaining good standing under this Agreement. Exclusivity
will be reviewed every six (6) months."

"Partner may not appoint sub-distributors, resellers, or agents without Company's
prior written consent, which may be withheld in Company's sole discretion."

"Upon termination, Partner shall immediately cease all marketing and sales activities
related to Solutions and shall not solicit Customers or Prospects for competing
solutions for a period of twelve (12) months."
```

### 3. Memoranda of Understanding (MoU)

**Standard Clauses 360 Uses:**

- **Non-Binding Nature**: Explicitly states MoU is not legally binding
- **One-Year Term**: Auto-renews unless terminated with 30 days notice
- **Confidentiality**: Survives termination of MoU
- **Publicity Rights**: Mutual approval required for announcements
- **No Financial Obligations**: No payment, investment, or funding commitments
- **Dispute Resolution**: For Brazilian partners, arbitration in São Paulo under CCBC rules

**Common Negotiation Points:**

**Publicity and Announcements**
- Partners often request: Freedom to announce partnership immediately
- 360's position: Mutual approval for specific deal terms, general collaboration okay
- Compromise: Can announce partnership generally, specific deal terms require approval

**Confidentiality Scope**
- Partners often request: Narrow confidentiality limited to "marked as confidential"
- 360's position: All business information presumed confidential unless public
- Compromise: Information shared in strategic discussions is confidential, publicly available info excluded

**Term and Renewal**
- Partners often request: Multi-year initial term
- 360's position: 1-year term with auto-renewal (allows flexibility)
- Compromise: Accept as-is (1-year auto-renewal is standard)

**Red Flags to Detect:**

- Language creating binding obligations (despite non-binding header)
- Automatic financial commitments
- Exclusive relationship preventing other partnerships
- Overly broad confidentiality covering public information
- Lack of termination rights
- Assignment to third parties without consent

**360-Specific Protections to Insert:**

```
"This MOU is not intended to create legally binding obligations but serves to
formalize the parties' intention to explore collaboration in good faith. A binding
agreement may be executed separately if mutually desired."

"Each party may publicly communicate about the collaboration in general terms.
Specific announcements regarding deal structures, equity proposals, or financial
terms require mutual written approval."

"Confidential Information shared during this collaboration shall not be disclosed
to third parties without prior written consent, except as required by law."
```

**For Brazilian Partners:**
```
"Any dispute arising from this MoU shall be resolved through arbitration in
São Paulo, Brazil, administered by Câmara de Comércio Brasil-Canadá (CCBC)
under Brazilian law."
```

## Risk Pattern Detection: What to Flag Immediately

### Critical Risk Patterns (🚨 Deal-Breakers)

**1. Unlimited Liability**
- **Clause**: "Provider is liable for any and all damages..."
- **Risk**: Catastrophic financial exposure
- **Redline**: "Provider's total liability shall be limited to fees paid under this Agreement"

**2. Unilateral Termination (Favoring Other Party)**
- **Clause**: "Client may terminate at any time without cause or penalty"
- **Risk**: Loss of expected revenue without compensation
- **Redline**: "Either party may terminate with 30 days written notice. Provider shall be compensated for all work completed through termination date."

**3. IP Assignment Beyond Scope**
- **Clause**: "All intellectual property created during the term belongs to Client"
- **Risk**: Loss of 360's methodologies, tools, frameworks
- **Redline**: "Client owns final deliverables. Provider retains all rights to pre-existing IP, methodologies, processes, and tools."

**4. Performance Without Payment**
- **Clause**: "Payment contingent upon achieving [subjective outcome]"
- **Risk**: Work performed but payment withheld
- **Redline**: "Payment based on delivery of specified deliverables, not outcomes beyond Provider's control."

**5. Auto-Renewal Without Escape**
- **Clause**: "Contract automatically renews for successive 2-year terms"
- **Risk**: Locked into unfavorable terms
- **Redline**: "Contract renews annually unless either party provides 60 days written notice of non-renewal."

---

### High Priority Risks (⚠️ Must Fix)

**1. Payment Terms Over 45 Days**
- **Flag if**: Net 60, Net 90, or "upon receipt of funding"
- **Risk**: Cash flow disruption
- **Redline**: "Payment due within 30 days of invoice. Late payments subject to 1.5% monthly interest."

**2. Indemnification Imbalance**
- **Flag if**: One-way indemnification favoring other party
- **Risk**: 360 assumes all legal risk
- **Redline**: "Mutual indemnification for breaches of respective obligations."

**3. Broad Confidentiality (One-Way)**
- **Flag if**: 360 must keep everything confidential, other party has no restrictions
- **Risk**: Competitive disadvantage
- **Redline**: "Mutual confidentiality obligations applying equally to both parties."

**4. Work-for-Hire Without Negotiation**
- **Flag if**: All work product is "work made for hire"
- **Risk**: Loss of portfolio examples, process improvements
- **Redline**: "Deliverables are Client property. Provider may use de-identified examples for marketing."

**5. Jurisdiction/Governing Law Disadvantages**
- **Flag if**: Dispute resolution in distant jurisdiction or unfavorable legal system
- **Risk**: Expensive litigation in unfamiliar courts
- **Redline**: "Governed by Washington State law, disputes resolved in King County, WA" (or mutual arbitration)

---

### Standard Improvements (📋 Best Practice)

**1. Vague Scope Language**
- **Flag if**: "and other duties as assigned" or "additional support as needed"
- **Risk**: Scope creep without additional compensation
- **Redline**: Specific deliverables list with change order process

**2. Missing Termination Rights**
- **Flag if**: No termination clause or only termination for cause
- **Risk**: Stuck in bad relationship
- **Redline**: "Either party may terminate for convenience with 30-60 days notice."

**3. No Limitation of Consequential Damages**
- **Flag if**: Silent on consequential damages
- **Risk**: Liable for indirect losses (lost profits, etc.)
- **Redline**: "Neither party liable for consequential, incidental, or punitive damages."

**4. Assignment Without Consent**
- **Flag if**: "Either party may assign this agreement"
- **Risk**: Contract transferred to unknown third party
- **Redline**: "Neither party may assign without prior written consent of the other party."

## International Deal Considerations

### Brazilian Partnership Patterns

**Cultural Negotiation Norms:**
- Expect longer relationship-building phase before contract signature
- Personal relationships and trust weigh heavily in decision-making
- Hierarchy matters: senior leaders often final decision-makers
- Payment timing may be more flexible due to currency considerations

**Standard Legal Provisions for Brazilian Deals:**
- **Governing Law**: Brazilian law (Federal Republic of Brazil)
- **Dispute Resolution**: CCBC arbitration in São Paulo
- **Language**: Contracts often bilingual (Portuguese/English), specify which version controls
- **Currency**: USD for international payments, but include currency fluctuation language
- **Anti-Corruption**: Explicit Brazilian anti-corruption law compliance
- **Tax**: Each party responsible for own taxes (no withholding by other party)

**Brazilian Deal-Specific Protections:**

```
"This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Brazil.
Any disputes shall be resolved through arbitration in São Paulo under CCBC rules."

"Each party shall comply with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including
Brazilian Anti-Corruption Law (Lei Anticorrupção - Lei 12.846/2013)."

"All payments shall be made in U.S. Dollars. Currency conversion, if needed,
shall use the exchange rate published by [Banco Central do Brasil] on the
payment due date."

"Each party is responsible for its own tax obligations. No party shall withhold
taxes from payments to the other party without prior written agreement."
```

---

### North American / European Deals

**Standard Provisions:**
- **Governing Law**: Washington State law (King County jurisdiction)
- **Dispute Resolution**: Mediation before litigation, or mutual arbitration
- **Language**: English only
- **Currency**: USD standard
- **Data Privacy**: GDPR compliance if EU partner, CCPA if California
- **Export Control**: Compliance with U.S. export regulations if technology transfer

---

## 360-Specific Business Model Protections

### Joint Venture Red Flags

360 co-founds or invests in portfolio companies through Enough Ventures

**Critical Issues:**

**1. Equity and Control Mismatch**
- **Flag if**: Equity % doesn't align with decision-making rights
- **Example**: 360 has 20% equity but no board seat or veto rights
- **Protection**: "Equity holders with >15% entitled to board observer rights"

**2. Deadlock Resolution**
- **Flag if**: No mechanism for resolving 50/50 decision deadlocks
- **Protection**: "Deadlock resolved by [mediation / buy-sell provision / designated tie-breaker]"

**3. Drag-Along / Tag-Along Rights**
- **Flag if**: Majority can force minority to sell without fair terms
- **Protection**: "Tag-along rights for all equity holders in any sale >25%"

**4. IP Ownership in Failed Ventures**
- **Flag if**: IP remains with entity even if venture dissolves
- **Protection**: "Upon dissolution, IP reverts to creating party or sold at fair market value"

---

### University Partnership Considerations

360 works with research institutions

**Standard Issues:**

**1. Bayh-Dole Act Compliance** (U.S. government-funded research)
- University must retain rights to federally funded IP
- 360 should negotiate license rights, not ownership

**2. Publication Rights**
- Universities typically require right to publish research
- Negotiate publication delay (90-180 days) for patent filing

**3. Background IP vs. Foreground IP**
- Universities keep pre-existing IP
- Negotiate license or joint ownership of new IP created during collaboration

---

### International Development Agreements

360 works with donors and international organizations

**Donor Restriction Clauses:**
- Acknowledge funding source restrictions in contract
- Ensure scope aligns with donor-approved budget
- Build in flexibility for scope changes if donor reduces funding

**Protection Language:**
```
"Provider's obligations are contingent upon continued availability of funding
from [Donor]. If funding is reduced or terminated, scope shall be adjusted
proportionally without penalty to Provider."
```

---

## Deal Type Classification and Standard Responses

---

### Step 2: Document Analysis

Tool automatically:
1. Identifies contract sections (term, payment, termination, liability, IP, etc.)
2. Extracts key data (parties, amounts, dates, obligations)
3. Maps sections to 360's standard clause library
4. Flags deviations from 360 standard positions

---

### Step 3: Risk Detection

Tool runs pattern matching:
1. Check against Critical Risk Patterns (deal-breakers)
2. Flag High Priority Risks (must fix)
3. Note Standard Improvements (best practices)
4. Consider deal context (adjust severity based on power dynamics, strategic value)

---

### Step 4: Redline Generation

Tool produces:

**1. Tracked Changes Document (.docx)**
- Deletions in strikethrough red
- Insertions in underlined blue
- Margin comments explaining each edit cluster

**2. Comment Categories in Margins:**
- 🚨 CRITICAL: Deal-breaker issues
- ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY: Significant risk/misalignment
- 📋 STANDARD: Best practice improvements
- 💡 OPPORTUNITY: Value-add suggestions
- 🤝 NEGOTIATION: Compromise options

**3. Executive Summary (1 page)**
- Deal snapshot
- Risk assessment
- Strategic alignment
- Top 5 must-wins
- Top 5 flexible points
- Overall recommendation

**4. Negotiation Brief**
- Opening position
- Priority matrix
- Compromise framework
- Talking points
- Cultural considerations (if international)
- BATNA analysis

---

## Quality Assurance Checklist

Before delivering redlined contract, verify:

### Technical Quality:
- ✅ All track changes render correctly in Microsoft Word
- ✅ Comments are anchored to correct text spans
- ✅ Formatting preserved from original
- ✅ All edits have corresponding explanatory comments
- ✅ No orphan comments or unexplained changes

### Substantive Quality:
- ✅ All critical risks addressed with redlines
- ✅ Proposed language is clear and specific (no vague terms)
- ✅ 360's standard protections included (payment, IP, liability, termination)
- ✅ Geographic/cultural considerations reflected (if international)
- ✅ Deal context reflected in aggressiveness of redlines

### Strategic Quality:
- ✅ Redlines won't kill deal (unless deal-breaker issue)
- ✅ Compromise options provided for negotiable points
- ✅ Cultural negotiation norms considered
- ✅ Talking points enable confident negotiation
- ✅ BATNA clearly articulated

---

## Example Redline Comment

**Original Clause:**
```
"Client may terminate this agreement at any time for any reason without penalty."
```

**Redlined:**
```
"Client Either party may terminate this agreement at any time for any reason upon
thirty (30) days' written notice without penalty. Upon termination, Client shall
pay Consultant for all work completed through the termination date, including work
in progress on a pro-rated basis."
```

**Margin Comment:**
```
[🚨 CRITICAL] One-sided termination without payment protection.

Issue: Original clause allows Client to terminate instantly without compensating
for work in progress. This creates significant financial risk, especially in
multi-month engagements.

Business Impact: If Client terminates after you've completed 80% of project work,
you could lose that revenue entirely.

Proposed Fix:
- Make termination mutual (either party can exit)
- Require 30-day notice period (industry standard)
- Ensure payment for completed work

Compromise Option: If Client insists on greater flexibility, consider:
"Client may terminate for convenience with 15 days notice and payment of 50% of
remaining contract value as termination fee, in addition to payment for work
completed."
```
