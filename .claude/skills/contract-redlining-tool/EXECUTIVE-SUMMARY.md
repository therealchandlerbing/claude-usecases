# Contract Redlining Tool: Executive Summary
**360 Social Impact Studios**

---

## The Challenge

360 reviews 15-20 contracts annually across client services, partnerships, and joint ventures. Each contract requires:
- 3-4 hours of manual review
- $500-2,000 in attorney fees for complex deals
- Multiple negotiation rounds due to missed risks
- Inconsistent terms across similar deal types

**Annual cost:** $30K-50K in attorney fees + opportunity cost from delayed deals

---

## The Solution

An automated contract redlining tool that analyzes incoming contracts against 360's standard positions and produces attorney-quality redlines with:

**Immediate Outputs:**
1. Redlined .docx with tracked changes and margin comments
2. Executive summary with risk assessment and recommendations
3. Negotiation brief with talking points and compromise options

**Business Benefits:**
- Review time: 3-4 hours → 30 minutes (85% reduction)
- Attorney costs: 50% reduction (tool handles routine reviews)
- Deal cycle: 20-30% faster closing
- Risk reduction: Consistent application of 360's protective clauses

## Knowledge Base Built

### 1. Contract Templates Analyzed

**Client Services** (ConnectMyVariant model)
- 50/50 payment structure (upfront + milestone)
- Deliverable-based scope with revision limits
- IP: Client owns deliverables, 360 keeps methodologies
- Independent contractor status

**Partnership Agreements** (Ecosystem Partner model)
- 25-30% commission (paid after customer payment received)
- Conditional exclusivity tied to performance
- 6-month prospect protection
- 12-month non-compete post-termination

**Memoranda of Understanding** (Brazilian partnerships)
- Non-binding framework for exploration
- Mutual confidentiality and publicity approval
- Brazilian law/CCBC arbitration for Brazilian partners
- 1-year auto-renewing term

### 2. Risk Patterns Identified

**Critical (🚨 Deal-Breakers):**
- Unlimited liability
- IP assignment of methodologies
- Payment contingent on subjective approval
- One-sided termination without payment
- Equity without governance rights

**High Priority (⚠️ Must Fix):**
- Payment terms over 45 days
- Unlimited revisions or scope
- One-way indemnification
- Immediate exclusivity without proof
- Commission before payment received

**Standard (📋 Best Practice):**
- Missing termination rights
- No consequential damages limitation
- Vague scope language
- Weak confidentiality

### 3. Protective Clause Library

**Payment Protection:**
- Net 15-30 payment terms with late fees
- 50/50 milestone structure
- Commission only after payment received

**IP Protection:**
- Deliverable ownership to client
- Methodology retention by 360
- Portfolio use rights (de-identified)

**Liability Protection:**
- Liability cap at fees paid
- No consequential damages
- Mutual indemnification

**Scope Protection:**
- Specific deliverable lists
- Defined revision rounds
- Change order process

**International Provisions:**
- Brazilian law/CCBC arbitration for Brazilian deals
- Currency fluctuation protections
- Anti-corruption compliance
