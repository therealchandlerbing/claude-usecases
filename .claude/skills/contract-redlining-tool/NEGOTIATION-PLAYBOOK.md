## Your Non-Negotiables (Never Sign Without These)

**Payment Protection:**
✓ Payment for work completed, even if contract terminates early
✓ Clear acceptance criteria (not subjective "satisfaction")
✓ Payment timing tied to delivery, not outcomes beyond your control

**IP Protection:**
✓ You retain methodologies, frameworks, and tools you developed
✓ Client owns final deliverables only
✓ Portfolio use rights (de-identified examples)

**Liability Cap:**
✓ Total liability limited to fees paid under agreement
✓ No liability for consequential damages (lost profits, etc.)
✓ Mutual indemnification (not one-sided)

**Termination Rights:**
✓ Either party can exit with reasonable notice (30-60 days)
✓ Payment for work completed through termination date
✓ No penalties for terminating a relationship that isn't working

## Standard Positions by Deal Type

### Client Services Contracts

**Payment:** 50% upfront, 50% at major milestone | Net 30 terms
**Scope:** Specific deliverables with 1-2 revision rounds
**IP:** Client owns deliverables, you keep methodologies
**Term:** Project duration or 12-24 months
**Termination:** 30-60 days notice, pay for work done

**Red lines you'll likely get pushback on:**
- 50% upfront (they'll want all at end)
- Limited revisions (they'll want unlimited)
- IP retention (they'll want to own everything)

**Your compromise positions:**
- Payment: Accept 40/60 split if established partner
- Revisions: Offer 2 rounds instead of 1, price 3rd+ at $X/round
- IP: Allow them to restrict portfolio use if sensitive, but keep methodologies

---

### Partnership/Distribution Deals

**Commission:** 25-30% (30% software, 25% services)
**Payment:** Only after you receive customer payment
**Exclusivity:** Conditional on first sale + performance minimums
**Prospect Protection:** 6 months (renewable if active)
**Non-Compete:** 12 months post-termination, narrowly defined
**Term:** 12 months with 30-day renewal notice

**Red lines you'll likely get pushback on:**
- Commission only after payment (they'll want immediate)
- Conditional exclusivity (they'll want day-1 exclusive)
- Performance minimums (they'll resist accountability)

**Your compromise positions:**
- Commission: Accept 35% if they take all implementation work
- Exclusivity: 6-month conditional period, then review
- Geography: Narrow to specific country if unproven partner

---

### MoU (Partnership Exploration)

**Nature:** Non-binding, no financial commitments
**Confidentiality:** Mutual, survives termination
**Publicity:** General announcement okay, deal terms need approval
**Term:** 1 year auto-renew with 30-day notice
**Governing Law:** Brazil for Brazilian partners, WA for U.S.

**Red lines you'll likely get pushback on:**
- Non-binding language (they may want commitments)
- Resource allocation (they may want guaranteed support)

**Your compromise positions:**
- Agree to "explore" and "discuss" projects (not commit)
- Agree to quarterly check-ins on partnership progress

## Common Pressure Points and Your Responses

### "We need you to start immediately, sign today"
**Your Response:** "I can start preliminary work under an email agreement while we finalize the contract. The contract protects both of us."

### "This is our standard contract, we can't change it"
**Your Response:** "I understand. I've marked the sections that create significant risk for my business. Let's discuss which are flexible and which matter most to you."

### "We can't pay anything upfront, that's not how we work"
**Your Response:** "I appreciate that. The upfront payment covers my initial setup costs. For established partners, I can do 40/60 instead of 50/50. Would that work?"

### "We need to own all the IP, including your methodologies"
**Your Response:** "The deliverables are yours completely. The methodologies are how I run my business, similar to a law firm owning its legal research process. I can't assign those and stay in business."

### "Net 60 days is our company policy, non-negotiable"
**Your Response:** "I can work with Net 45 if we add a late payment interest clause. That protects both of us if something falls through the cracks."

### "We need unlimited revisions to get this right"
**Your Response:** "I want to get it right too. I include 2 revision rounds, which has been plenty for similar projects. If we need more, we can address that with a quick amendment. Does 2 rounds work to start?"

### "This is a small deal, why are we negotiating so hard?"
**Your Response:** "You're right that the dollar amount is modest. These clauses create risk far beyond this project's value. I'd rather start our partnership on solid footing."

## Power Dynamics Guide

### When You Need Them More (Weak Position)
**Accept:** Longer payment terms (Net 45-60), more revision rounds, lower upfront %
**Fight for:** IP protection, liability cap, termination rights, payment for work done
**Strategy:** Pick 2-3 must-haves, be flexible on everything else

### When It's Balanced (Equal Footing)
**Hold firm:** Standard positions on payment, IP, liability, termination
**Negotiate:** Specific timelines, deliverable details, pricing structure
**Strategy:** Professional but firm, willing to walk if terms don't work

### When They Need You More (Strong Position)
**Push for:** Better payment terms (Net 15-20), higher rates, favorable scope
**Consider:** Volume discounts, longer commitments if rates are good
**Strategy:** Be gracious in strength, build long-term relationship

## Cultural Negotiation Notes

### Brazilian Partners
**Expect:** Longer relationship-building before contract signature
**Approach:** Personal connection before business terms
**Legal:** Offer Brazilian governing law and CCBC arbitration (shows respect)
**Payment:** Be flexible on timing due to currency/banking complexity
**Hierarchy:** Senior leaders often need to approve, even if not day-to-day contact

### U.S. Corporate Partners
**Expect:** Legal and procurement reviews, multiple stakeholders
**Approach:** Business case first, then legal terms
**Legal:** Washington law and jurisdiction standard
**Payment:** Net 30-45 common, push for Net 30
**Hierarchy:** Decision-makers may not be your day-to-day contact

### European Partners
**Expect:** Data privacy concerns (GDPR), formal communication style
**Approach:** Detailed scope documentation, clear deliverables
**Legal:** May prefer their country's law, arbitration is good compromise
**Payment:** Often slower (Net 60), build in buffer
**Hierarchy:** Collaborative decision-making, consensus-oriented

## When to Walk Away

**Walk if:**
- They want ownership of your core methodologies/frameworks
- Unlimited liability without cap
- Payment entirely contingent on subjective approval
- Work-for-hire clause transferring all IP
- Non-compete preventing you from serving other clients
- Exclusive rights without any performance requirements

**Pause and escalate to attorney if:**
- Complex joint venture with equity/governance issues
- International deal with unfamiliar jurisdiction
- University partnership with Bayh-Dole implications
- Government contract with compliance requirements
- Deal value >$100K with unusual terms

**Red flags that signal bad partner:**
- Pressuring you to sign without reading
- Dismissive of your concerns ("this is standard")
- Unwilling to explain why specific terms matter to them
- Changing terms after verbal agreement
- Multiple revisions to "final" contract

## Negotiation Email Templates

### Requesting Changes (Collaborative Tone)
```
Subject: Contract Review - [Project Name]

Hi [Name],

Thanks for sending the contract. I've reviewed it and overall the structure
looks good. I've marked a few sections that create risk for my business:

1. [Issue]: The current language [problem]. Could we adjust to [solution]?
2. [Issue]: [Problem]. I'm comfortable with [compromise].
3. [Issue]: This one is important for me because [reason].

I've attached a redlined version for your review. Happy to discuss by phone
if that's easier. I'm excited to work together and want to make sure we're
both protected.

Best,
Chandler
```

### Standing Firm on Non-Negotiable (Professional but Clear)
```
Subject: Re: Contract Terms - IP Ownership

Hi [Name],

I appreciate you explaining your perspective on the IP ownership clause.

Unfortunately, I can't assign ownership of my methodologies and frameworks.
They're the foundation of how I serve all my clients. It would be like asking
a law firm to assign its legal research process to each client.

What I can do: You own all the deliverables I create for you (reports,
presentations, analysis), and I'm happy to restrict portfolio use if this
involves sensitive information.

What I can't do: Assign the underlying methodologies, processes, and tools
I use to create those deliverables.

Is there a specific concern this clause is meant to address? I'm happy to
discuss alternative ways to protect your interests.

Best,
Chandler
```

### Proposing Compromise (Finding Middle Ground)
```
Subject: Re: Payment Terms - Proposal

Hi [Name],

I understand Net 60 is your standard policy. Here's a proposal that might
work for both of us:

- Payment 1 (40%): Due within 15 days of contract signature
- Payment 2 (60%): Due at project completion, Net 30

This gets me some working capital upfront while reducing your initial outlay.
The majority payment stays at Net 30 instead of Net 15.

Alternatively, I can do Net 45 instead of Net 60, which helps my cash flow
enough to make it work.

Would either of those work on your end?

Best,
Chandler
```

## Emergency Contacts

**For legal review ($200-500 range):**
- Contract review services (UpCounsel, LegalZoom)
- Local business attorney (for complex deals)

**For deal value assessment:**
- Run numbers on what you'd lose if terms go bad
- Compare to similar deals you've done
- Factor in relationship value beyond this contract

**Your gut check:**
- Does this feel fair?
- Would I recommend this deal to a friend?
- Am I signing because of pressure or because it's good?

*Trust your instincts. If something feels wrong, it probably is. Better to walk away from a bad deal than spend months in a bad partnership.*

**Remember:** You're building a sustainable business, not just closing this deal. The right partners will respect your boundaries. The wrong ones will pressure you to ignore them.
