## Overview

The Contract Redlining Tool is an automated contract review and analysis system that produces attorney-quality redlines with tracked changes, margin comments, and comprehensive negotiation guidance. Built from 360's actual contract templates and negotiation patterns, this skill applies institutional knowledge to protect 360's interests while building strong partnerships.

## Purpose

Transform contract review from a time-consuming, attorney-dependent process into a fast, consistent, and strategic capability. The tool identifies risks, generates professional redlines, and provides negotiation guidance tailored to deal type, power dynamics, and cultural context.

## Key Features

### Intelligent Risk Detection
- **Critical Risks (🚨)**: Deal-breakers like unlimited liability, IP assignment of methodologies, payment without delivery
- **High Priority (⚠️)**: Significant issues like payment terms >45 days, unlimited scope, one-way indemnification
- **Standard Improvements (📋)**: Best practices like termination rights, consequential damages limitations

### Multi-Format Deal Support
- **Client Services** - 50/50 payment, deliverable-based scope, IP protection
- **Partnerships** - Commission structure, exclusivity terms, prospect protection
- **MoUs** - Non-binding language, confidentiality, publicity rights
- **Joint Ventures** - Equity alignment, board rights, IP ownership
- **International** - Brazilian law/arbitration, currency protection, cultural considerations

### Professional Deliverables
1. **Redlined .docx** - Tracked changes with margin comments categorized by severity
2. **Executive Summary** - 1-page risk assessment with must-wins and flexible points
3. **Negotiation Brief** - Talking points, compromise options, cultural guidance

### Cultural Intelligence
- **Brazilian Partnerships** - CCBC arbitration, PTAX currency rates, relationship-building norms
- **European Deals** - GDPR compliance, formal documentation, consensus orientation
- **U.S. Corporate** - Standard payment terms, procurement processes, stakeholder coordination

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

Invoke the skill and provide:
1. Contract document (upload or paste text)
2. Deal type (Client Services, Partnership, MoU, Joint Venture, etc.)
3. Context (strategic importance, power dynamics, key concerns)

The skill will analyze the contract and produce redlines with negotiation guidance.

### Example Requests

```
Review this partnership agreement. It's a balanced deal with a Brazilian
biotech company. Main concerns: payment timing and IP ownership.
```

```
Analyze this client services contract. They're a critical strategic partner,
but I'm worried about the unlimited revisions clause and Net 60 payment terms.
```

```
Redline this MoU with a U.S. foundation. It's exploratory, but they want
immediate exclusive rights which seems premature.
```

## 360's Standard Positions

### Client Services Contracts
- **Payment:** 50% upfront, 50% at milestone | Net 30 terms
- **Scope:** Specific deliverables with 1-2 revision rounds
- **IP:** Client owns deliverables, 360 keeps methodologies
- **Liability:** Cap at fees paid, no consequential damages
- **Termination:** 30-60 days notice, payment for work done

### Partnership Agreements
- **Commission:** 25-30% (30% software, 25% services)
- **Payment:** Only after 360 receives customer payment
- **Exclusivity:** Conditional on first sale + performance minimums
- **Non-Compete:** 12 months post-termination, narrowly defined
- **Prospect Protection:** 6 months (renewable if active)

### Memoranda of Understanding
- **Nature:** Non-binding, no financial commitments
- **Confidentiality:** Mutual, survives termination
- **Publicity:** General announcement okay, deal terms need approval
- **Term:** 1 year auto-renew with 30-day notice
- **Governing Law:** Brazil for Brazilian partners, Washington for U.S.

## Non-Negotiables

360 will **not** accept:
- IP assignment of methodologies, frameworks, or tools
- Unlimited liability without caps
- Payment contingent on subjective "satisfaction"
- One-sided termination without payment for completed work
- Equity without governance/information rights
- Automatic renewal without exit rights

These are deal-breakers. Walk away if the partner insists.

## When to Use

**Use this skill for:**
- Reviewing contracts from partners, clients, or collaborators
- Identifying risks and misalignment with 360's positions
- Preparing negotiation strategy and talking points
- Comparing terms across similar deals
- Training team on contract standards

**Don't use this skill for:**
- Drafting contracts from scratch (use templates)
- Simple contract questions
- Non-contract legal matters
- Deals over $100K (involve attorney)

## Expected Outcomes

### Efficiency Gains
- **Review time:** 3-4 hours → 30 minutes (85% reduction)
- **Attorney costs:** 50% reduction (tool handles routine reviews)
- **Deal cycle:** 20-30% faster closing

### Quality Improvements
- 100% of critical risks identified
- Consistent terms across similar deals
- Professional, well-reasoned redlines
- Confident negotiation with clear talking points

### Business Impact
- **Payment terms:** Reduce average payment days by 15
- **Scope protection:** Prevent unpaid scope creep (20%+ margin improvement)
- **IP protection:** Retain methodologies for multi-client service
- **Risk reduction:** Fewer post-signature disputes

## Deliverable Examples

### Redlined Document
```
Original: "Client may terminate this agreement at any time for any reason
without penalty."

Redlined: "Client Either party may terminate this agreement at any time for
any reason upon thirty (30) days' written notice without penalty. Upon
termination, Client shall pay Consultant for all work completed through the
termination date, including work in progress on a pro-rated basis."

Margin Comment: [🚨 CRITICAL] One-sided termination without payment protection.
Issue: Original allows Client to terminate instantly without compensating for
work in progress. Business Impact: If Client terminates after 80% of work, you
could lose that revenue. Proposed Fix: Make termination mutual, require 30-day
notice, ensure payment for completed work.
```

### Executive Summary
```
DEAL SNAPSHOT
Parties: 360 Social Impact Studios + Acme Corp
Value: $26,000 professional services
Term: 12 months
Type: Client Services Contract

RISK ASSESSMENT
🚨 Critical Issues: 1 (IP assignment of methodologies)
⚠️ High Priority: 3 (Net 60 payment, unlimited revisions, one-way indemnification)
📋 Standard: 2 (missing termination rights, vague scope)

RECOMMENDATION: NEGOTIATE
This deal is viable but requires significant revisions to payment terms,
IP ownership, and scope boundaries. Partner will likely accept changes if
presented professionally with business rationale.

TOP 5 MUST-WINS
1. Retain ownership of methodologies (non-negotiable)
2. Payment for work completed if contract terminates
3. Specific deliverables with revision limits
4. Reduce payment terms to Net 30-45
5. Mutual indemnification

TOP 5 FLEXIBLE POINTS
1. Can accept Net 45 instead of Net 30
2. Can offer 2 revision rounds instead of 1
3. Can restrict portfolio use if sensitive
4. Can accept 40/60 payment split instead of 50/50
5. Can extend notice period to 60 days

## Common Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Brazilian Partnership
**Context:** MoU with Brazilian biotech, exploring collaboration on innovation initiatives

**Issues Detected:**
- Governing law as Washington State (should be Brazil)
- No arbitration clause (expensive cross-border litigation)
- Vague publicity rights (could leak sensitive deal terms)

**Redlines Applied:**
- Change to Brazilian governing law with CCBC arbitration in São Paulo
- Add PTAX currency conversion language
- Distinguish general publicity (allowed) from deal specifics (requires approval)

**Outcome:** Professional redlines that show respect for partner's jurisdiction while protecting 360's interests

### Scenario 2: Client Services Overreach
**Context:** $26K services contract with unlimited revisions and subjective approval

**Issues Detected:**
- Payment contingent on "satisfactory deliverables" (subjective)
- "Revisions as needed" (unlimited free work)
- Net 60 payment terms (cash flow issue)

**Redlines Applied:**
- Tie payment to delivery with 10-day acceptance window
- Limit to 1-2 revision rounds, price additional rounds
- Reduce to Net 30 with late payment interest

**Outcome:** Protected against scope creep while maintaining good client relationship

### Scenario 3: Partnership Exclusivity
**Context:** New Latin America partner wants immediate exclusive rights

**Issues Detected:**
- Day-1 exclusivity without proving capability
- Covers entire continent (massive geographic lock-up)
- No performance requirements or review process

**Redlines Applied:**
- Change to conditional exclusivity requiring first sale
- Narrow geography to Brazil only
- Add performance minimums and quarterly reviews
- Right to terminate exclusivity while continuing partnership

**Outcome:** Protected against locking up entire region with unproven partner

## Success Stories

### Payment Terms
**Before:** Net 60-90 days common, cash flow challenges
**After:** Net 30-45 standard, 15-day reduction in average payment timing
**Impact:** $15K+ annual cash flow improvement

### Scope Protection
**Before:** Unlimited revisions led to 5-7 rounds on some deliverables
**After:** 1-2 rounds standard, additional rounds billed
**Impact:** 20%+ margin improvement, prevented $20K+ unpaid work

### IP Protection
**Before:** Case-by-case negotiation, sometimes lost methodologies
**After:** Consistent position, 100% methodology retention
**Impact:** Enables multi-client service model with same frameworks

## Walk-Away Criteria

Recommend walking away if partner insists on:
- Ownership of 360's core methodologies/frameworks
- Unlimited liability without caps
- Payment entirely on subjective approval
- Work-for-hire transferring all IP
- Non-compete preventing other client work
- Exclusive rights without performance requirements

Better to skip one deal than sign a contract that damages the business.

## Escalation Guidelines

Involve an attorney for:
- Deals over $100K
- Joint ventures with equity/governance issues
- Unfamiliar international jurisdictions
- University partnerships (Bayh-Dole implications)
- Government contracts (compliance requirements)
- Unusual terms not in knowledge base
- Unreasonable or aggressive counterparties
