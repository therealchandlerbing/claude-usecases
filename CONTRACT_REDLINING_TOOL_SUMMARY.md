## 360's Standard Positions

### Client Services
- **Payment:** 50% upfront, 50% at milestone | Net 30 terms
- **IP:** Client owns deliverables, 360 retains methodologies
- **Scope:** 1-2 revision rounds, change order for additions
- **Liability:** Cap at fees paid, no consequential damages

### Partnerships
- **Commission:** 25-30% (paid only after customer payment received)
- **Exclusivity:** Conditional on first sale + $100K annual minimum
- **Non-Compete:** 12 months, narrowly defined to direct competition
- **Prospect Protection:** 6 months, renewable if active

### MoUs (Memoranda of Understanding)
- **Nature:** Explicitly non-binding, no financial commitments
- **Governing Law:** Brazil for Brazilian partners (CCBC arbitration), Washington for U.S.
- **Publicity:** General announcement okay, deal terms need approval
- **Confidentiality:** Mutual, survives termination

---

## Non-Negotiables

360 will **NEVER** accept:
- ❌ IP assignment of methodologies, frameworks, or tools
- ❌ Unlimited liability without caps
- ❌ Payment contingent on subjective "satisfaction"
- ❌ One-sided termination without payment for completed work
- ❌ Equity without governance/information rights
- ❌ Automatic renewal without exit rights

**These are deal-breakers. Walk away if partner insists.**

## Example: What a Redline Looks Like

**Original Clause:**
```
Client may terminate this agreement at any time for any reason without penalty.
```

**Redlined:**
```
Either party may terminate this agreement upon thirty (30) days' written notice.
Upon termination, Client shall pay Consultant for all work completed through the
termination date, including work in progress on a pro-rated basis.
```

**Margin Comment:**
```
[🚨 CRITICAL] One-sided termination without payment protection.

Issue: Original allows instant termination without compensating for work in progress.
Business Impact: Could lose 80% of revenue if terminated late in project.
Proposed Fix: Make termination mutual, require 30-day notice, ensure payment.
Compromise: 15-day notice + 50% termination fee option.
```

## Cultural Intelligence

### Brazilian Partnerships
- Use CCBC arbitration in São Paulo (shows respect, faster than U.S. litigation)
- Reference PTAX exchange rate from Banco Central do Brasil
- Expect longer relationship-building before contract signature
- Senior leaders often need final approval

### European Partners
- GDPR compliance required for data handling
- Formal communication and detailed documentation expected
- Consensus-oriented decision-making (multiple stakeholders)
- Payment often Net 60 (build in buffer)

### U.S. Corporate
- Legal and procurement reviews with multiple stakeholders
- Business case before legal terms
- Net 30-45 standard, push for Net 30
- Decision-makers may differ from day-to-day contacts
