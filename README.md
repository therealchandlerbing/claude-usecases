### Tips for Effective AI Execution

2. **Reference Data Sources**: Mention where your data lives (e.g., "from our Asana projects and Gmail threads")
3. **Specify Output Format**: Request "HTML dashboard," "Mermaid diagram," or "executive summary" as needed
4. **Chain Skills**: For complex workflows, mention multiple needs and the skill-orchestrator will coordinate

Each skill has detailed documentation in its respective directory with quick-start guides, implementation details, and example outputs.
