# Strategic Initiatives Workflow
## Specialized Reference for Board Packet Strategic Updates

This file is loaded just-in-time when generating the Strategic Initiatives Update component of the board packet.

---

## Purpose

Transform Asana project data, Gmail partnership communications, and organizational context into an executive assessment of progress against 360's four strategic priorities. This report connects tactical execution to strategic vision and identifies where board support is needed.

---

## The Four Strategic Priorities

From Board Motion #7 (adopted in prior meeting):

1. **Expand program reach** - Grow impact and client base
2. **Diversify funding sources** - Reduce dependency on single revenue streams
3. **Build strategic partnerships** - Focus on Brazil, China, and technology sectors
4. **Convert pipeline to revenue** - Improve close rates and shorten sales cycles

---

## Data Inputs

### From Asana

**Strategic Projects**:
- Projects tagged as "strategic" or in strategic partnership category
- Major initiatives (SpacePlan JV, GenIP, ScienceLink, NanoBioPlus, CNEN)
- Milestones completed vs. planned
- Tasks and deliverables status

**Pipeline Conversion Data**:
- Conversion rates by stage
- Time in each stage
- Win/loss analysis (if tracked)

### From Gmail

**Partnership Communications**:
- SpacePlan: Email count, last contact, key topics
- GenIP: Engagement patterns
- ScienceLink: Franchise development communications
- NanoBioPlus/CuriBio: Collaboration depth
- CNEN/Brazil: Government partnership status
- China partnerships: Any active communications

### From User Context

**Strategic Milestones** (from prior board meetings or strategic plans):
- Goals set for this fiscal year
- Quarterly objectives
- Partnership targets

---

## Report Structure

### 1. Executive Summary (4 Paragraphs, One Per Priority)

**Template**:

"**Expand Program Reach**: 360 has [expanded/maintained/contracted] its program reach with [X metric, e.g., '3 new client relationships' or 'launch of ScienceLink franchise framework']. [Key achievement]. [Next quarter focus].

**Diversify Funding Sources**: Revenue diversification has [improved/remained stable/declined] with [X metric, e.g., 'licensing revenue now 30% of total, up from 15%']. [Key development]. [Opportunity or risk].

**Build Strategic Partnerships**: Major partnership progress includes [SpacePlan JV status], [Brazil/CNEN progress], and [any China developments]. [Assessment of partnership momentum]. [Board decision needed, if any].

**Convert Pipeline to Revenue**: Pipeline conversion has [improved/declined] with [X metric, e.g., 'win rate of 40%, up from 30%' or 'average close time reduced to 45 days']. [Key factor driving performance]. [Action to further improve]."

Each paragraph should be 3-4 sentences, factual, and action-oriented.

### 4. Cross-Initiative Synergies

Identify where initiatives reinforce each other:

**Example**:
"The SpacePlan JV provides technology capability that strengthens the NanoBioPlus collaboration, as both involve deep tech commercialization. The ScienceLink franchise model can leverage GenIP's intellectual property commercialization expertise. Brazil (CNEN) and China market development both benefit from 360's government partnership experience."

**Strategic Leverage Opportunities**:
- [How initiative A enables initiative B]
- [Shared capabilities or resources across initiatives]
- [Partnership connections that could be cross-leveraged]

---

### 5. Resource Allocation Assessment

**Current Resource Distribution**:

| Initiative | Team Time | Budget | External Partners |
|-----------|-----------|--------|------------------|
| SpacePlan JV | [X%] | $[Y] | SpacePlan, Enough |
| GenIP | [X%] | $[Y] | GenIP partners |
| ScienceLink | [X%] | $[Y] | [Partners] |
| NanoBioPlus | [X%] | $[Y] | NanoBioPlus, CuriBio |
| CNEN/Brazil | [X%] | $[Y] | CNEN, Felipe |
| China | [X%] | $[Y] | [Partners TBD] |
| **Total** | **100%** | **$[Total]** | |

**Alignment with Priorities**:
"Resource allocation [is/is not] aligned with strategic priorities. [If misaligned: 'Consider rebalancing toward higher-priority initiatives.' If aligned: 'Current allocation supports priority objectives.']"

---

### 6. Risk & Opportunity Matrix

**Strategic Risks**:

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| [Risk 1, e.g., "SpacePlan JV delayed"] | H/M/L | H/M/L | [Action] | [Person] |
| [Risk 2] | H/M/L | H/M/L | [Action] | [Person] |

**Strategic Opportunities**:

| Opportunity | Timing | Value Potential | Requirements | Decision Needed |
|------------|--------|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| [Opp 1, e.g., "Brazil expansion beyond CNEN"] | [Timeframe] | $[X] | [Resources] | [Yes/No] |
| [Opp 2] | [Timeframe] | $[X] | [Resources] | [Yes/No] |

---

If any initiative requires board approval or input, consolidate here:

**Decisions Needed This Meeting**:
1. [Decision 1, e.g., "Approve SpacePlan JV governance framework"]
2. [Decision 2, e.g., "Authorize resource allocation for China market entry"]
3. [Decision 3]

**Decisions for Future Meetings**:

## Data Collection Logic

### Asana Strategic Projects

```python

    # Check for stalled strategic projects
    for project in strategic_projects:
